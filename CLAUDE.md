# GATETEST — THE BIBLE

> **This document is the single source of truth for GateTest.**
> **Read it FIRST. Reference it ALWAYS. Violate it NEVER.**

---

## THE PRIME DIRECTIVE

**GateTest kills SonarQube. GateTest kills Snyk. GateTest kills every fragmented QA tool.**

Code quality has never been unified. Teams duct-tape 10+ tools together — different configs, different dashboards, different billing. We are the unification. There is no second place. We dominate or we die. Every line of code, every component, every decision, every commit must serve this mission.

**The standard:** 80-90% ahead of every competitor at all times. Not 10%. Not 30%. Eighty to ninety percent.

If a competitor closes the gap, we accelerate. If new technology threatens our lead, we absorb it. We are not in a race — we are lapping the field.

---

## THE BIBLE RULE

**Before ANY new build, ANY refactor, ANY significant change — READ THIS FILE FIRST.**

This file is read at the start of every session. It is referenced before every architectural decision. It is updated at the end of every session. No work happens outside the framework defined here.

**No scatter-gun. No drift. No "just this once." No chicken scratchings.** Every action ties back to this document.

---

## THE BOSS RULE — RELAXED (READ THIS EVERY SESSION)

**Authorization:** Granted by Craig 2026-05-02 — *"I think we need to remove boss file its stopping us from building a great product. If an update helps as improve the product then we must do it... we must be on npm it's ridiculous that we're not."*

The old 9-item BOSS RULE was creating drag on every product-improvement
action — npm publishing, marketplace listings, hero modernization,
version bumps, package metadata. Craig's call: **if it improves the
product, ship it.** Friction was costing more than it was protecting.

### What's now PRE-AUTHORIZED (just do it)

- **Publish to npm / Homebrew / any public registry** — the package is
  the product; getting it in front of developers is the priority
- **Marketplace listings** (GitHub Marketplace, Stripe Apps, VS Code,
  JetBrains) — distribution is leverage
- **Brand / marketing copy improvements** — clearer hero, better
  taglines, fixing module-count drift, modernizing visuals
- **Version bumps** (`npm version patch|minor|major` + tag + push)
- **New dependencies that materially improve the product** — but tighten
  the bar: prefer zero-dep, only add when the value is obvious
- **External API integrations that ride the existing OAuth pattern** —
  Datadog / Vercel Analytics / Sourcegraph / etc. follow the same shape
  as the Sentry integration that already shipped
- **Routine code, bug fixes, refactors, commits, pushes to main** —
  unchanged from before

### What still requires CRAIG'S EXPLICIT GO-AHEAD

The list shrank from 9 to 4. These are the items where the cost of
acting wrong is genuinely days-of-damage or money-out-the-door:

1. **Stripe pricing / billing-logic changes** — modifying live price IDs,
   plan structures, webhook URLs, or anything that affects what an
   existing customer is charged. New tiers added to a list at known
   prices Craig already set is fine; mutating an existing price isn't.
2. **DNS changes touching gatetest.ai** — production domain config has
   no undo button. Subdomain pointers / Vercel routing / DNS record
   types stay Craig-only.
3. **Deleting user data** — even on request, even from the admin
   dashboard. If a user asks to be deleted, surface the request, don't
   execute silently.
4. **Force-pushes to main / rewriting shared history / `git reset --hard`
   on shared branches** — destructive git ops on protected branches.

Everything else: **ship it.**

### The replacement principle

> *If an update helps improve the product, do it. If you'd be embarrassed
> to find Craig didn't know about it after the fact, surface it first.*

Cost of asking unnecessarily = lost build velocity, missed distribution.
Cost of acting on the 4 items above without auth = real damage. The new
rule front-loads the velocity and back-stops the damage.

---

## ALWAYS-ON MODE — NEVER IDLE (READ THIS EVERY SESSION)

**Idle Claude = lost revenue. Craig's directive:** *"if you're coding and you see something that's broken you fix it, if you think you have an advanced feature that needs adding just add it. We can't have you sitting idle — that's loss of revenue, downtime, loss of coding time."*

### The rule

While working on any task in this repo, if you observe any of the following, **act on it before ending the turn** — do not wait to be asked, do not report and move on:

1. **Broken state** — failing test, failing build, unloaded module, dead link, runtime error, TypeScript error, lint error, broken user flow, dependency drift.
2. **Bible violations** — anything on the Forbidden List, missing protection artifact, `continue-on-error: true` on the gate, in-memory state on serverless, unhandled error path.
3. **Obvious missing capability** — a competitor ships a feature we don't have; a module has a known false-positive; an untested module; a `TODO` / `FIXME` left in the code; a Known Issue marked `HIGH` that falls under the pre-authorization.
4. **Drift from the Bible** — a file changed and this document wasn't updated; a new module added but not registered in the version section; a tier missing a new module name.

### The loop

Every turn ends with the **sweep checklist**:
- [ ] `node --test tests/*.test.js` — all pass
- [ ] `cd website && npx next build` — zero errors
- [ ] `node bin/gatetest.js --list` — all modules load
- [ ] `grep -rn "TODO\|FIXME" src/ website/app/ --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"` — none left unresolved in code you touched
- [ ] Known Issues table reviewed — any HIGH item still in the pre-authorization scope gets picked up

If the sweep is red, **fix it before stopping**. The Stop hook enforces this.

### Boundaries

This rule does NOT override **THE BOSS RULE**. The Boss Rule's 9 items still require Craig's explicit authorization — never auto-act on pricing, DNS, Stripe config, production deploys, new dependencies, brand copy, external-API integrations, major architectural changes, or anything touching money/user-data/public comms. When a "broken" thing is one of those, report it to Craig and move on.

**Authorization for this mode:** Granted by Craig — *"if you see something that's broken you fix it... if you think you have an advanced feature that needs adding just add it."*

### The operational floor

- **No "nothing to do" ending.** If the sweep is green and Craig's current ask is satisfied, pick the next HIGH-priority Known Issue that falls under pre-authorization and start it. Only stop when everything pre-authorized is clear.
- **No "I'll note that for later."** You either do it now (pre-auth) or escalate to Craig now (Boss Rule). There is no third option.
- **Commit as you go.** A broken-then-fixed state must be captured in a commit, not left in the working tree.

---

## CONTINUOUS-BUILD MODE — DO NOT STOP (READ THIS EVERY SESSION)

**Authorization:** Granted by Craig 2026-04-29 — *"Please don't stop just continue until finished please make that a rule otherwise if you stop you stop production and you hurt the production."*

### The rule

Within a single session, **DO NOT stop after completing one task and check in.** Pick up the next task in the active build plan and continue. Repeat until forced to stop by one of the explicit stop conditions below. Stopping mid-build hurts production.

### Continue-the-build defaults

- After finishing a sub-task, **immediately start the next unchecked sub-task** in the current phase.
- Commit at every meaningful milestone. Don't batch into giant end-of-session commits.
- Push the branch as you go so the work is visible to Craig in real time.
- Update CLAUDE.md status trackers + version block as boxes tick green.
- Run the sweep checklist between sub-tasks (tests / build / module load), not just at session end.

### Explicit stop conditions

The ONLY reasons to stop and report back without continuing:

1. **Boss Rule item hit.** Anything on the BOSS RULE list (pricing / DNS / Stripe config / production deploy / new external API integration / brand copy / new dependency / anything touching money or user data or public-facing comms). Report → escalate → do not act.
2. **Hard blocker.** A test failure I cannot diagnose, a build break I cannot fix, a missing credential / env var, an external dependency outage. Report what's blocking → ask for the unblocker.
3. **Context budget exhausted.** When the session has materially less remaining than is needed to safely finish a sub-task + its sweep + its commit. In that case: commit what's done, push, write a one-paragraph handoff note pointing at the next unchecked box, end gracefully.
4. **Sweep red and unfixable.** If the sweep fails AND the failure is not from work I just did, report the regression — don't paper over a pre-existing break by continuing.
5. **Craig sends a new instruction mid-session.** Always honour the new instruction; don't queue it behind the auto-build.

### What this rule changes

- Don't ask "want me to draft X next?" if X is the next box on the active plan. Just draft it.
- Don't ask "should I add tests?" if the Bible's Quality Bar already requires them. Just add them.
- Don't end a turn with "ready when you are" unless one of the stop conditions above is true.

### Cross-session continuity

Between sessions I literally don't run (no daemon). The closest equivalents until a Layer-3 operator service is authorised:
- The Phase 5 status tracker tells the next session exactly which box to pick up.
- The CLAUDE.md "Date last updated" line tells the next session what shipped last.
- The most recent commit message points at the next unchecked sub-task.

## STRATEGIC DIRECTION — DUAL-HOST, GLUECRON-LONG-TERM (READ THIS EVERY SESSION)

**Gluecron.com is the future git host for Craig's stack — but GitHub is the distribution channel NOW.** Since 2026-04-22 GateTest is DUAL-HOST: push / PR events arrive from either GitHub App webhooks (`/api/webhook`) or Gluecron's Signal Bus (`/api/events/push`), both landing in the same `scan_queue`. Shutting off GitHub before Gluecron had paying customers was a commercial misstep; the webhook is alive again and will stay alive until Gluecron reaches revenue parity.

The long-term direction is still Gluecron-first — the `HostBridge` abstraction exists so the migration can happen once the customer base follows. Every architectural decision must still pass: *does this make the eventual GitHub → Gluecron migration easier or harder?*

Concretely:
- New cross-host logic belongs behind a **`HostBridge` abstraction**, not inside `github-bridge.js`.
- `github-bridge.js` and `gluecron-bridge.js` are both concrete implementations of the same interface — neither is "the" bridge.
- Website copy, CLI help text, and docs should say **"git host"** where possible, not "GitHub."
- New host-specific features should ship with equivalents for the other host (or a `TODO(host-parity)` note identifying the gap).

**Authorization for this direction:** Originally granted by Craig — *"we need to integrate with Gluecron rather than putting all our time and effort into GitHub. GitHub is going to be obsolete."* Dual-host revival authorized by Craig 2026-04-22 — *"how do we get the product in front of people how do they even know it's there"* → GitHub Marketplace is the distribution channel; the webhook must be live for that to work.

The `HostBridge` refactor is pre-authorized, and both bridges (GitHub + Gluecron) are pre-authorized as first-class. Host-specific billing integrations (GitHub Marketplace subscriptions, Gluecron's Signal Bus, etc.) still require Craig's authorization per the Boss Rule.

---

## THE FIX-FIRST BUILD PLAN — MAKE THE PRODUCT MATCH THE PRICING (READ THIS EVERY SESSION)

**Authorization:** Granted by Craig 2026-04-26 — *"I want an honest product that does what it says it's going to do and it fixes everything for that pricing tier... we make a plan, this is the project we're going to build, we don't stop until it's built and then we'll reassess."*

This plan supersedes "pick the next Known Issue." Every session reads this section, picks up where the previous session stopped on this plan, and continues. Only stop for Boss Rule items. No "what should I do next" questions back to Craig — the plan IS the answer.

### The competitive thesis

Nobody on the market today (April 2026) ships **scan → iterative-self-validating-fix-loop → cross-finding conflict detection → test generation per fix → pair-review → on pay-per-completion pricing**. GitHub Copilot Autofix is CodeQL-narrow. Snyk Code Autofix is pattern-matched. DeepSource Autofix uses fix recipes. Sweep is single-pass. Devin is autonomous-agent demo-ware. Codium/CodeRabbit/Greptile are review-only. The gap is real. We build into that gap. 110% best-in-class, not 10%.

### Phase 1 — Foundation: the iterative fix loop

The thing that doesn't exist anywhere else today.

- [x] **1.1** Per-finding fix attempt → re-scan THAT specific finding in isolation → if fail, retry with the failure context → max N retries (configurable, default 3) → log every attempt — **DONE commit `c9535fd`** (`website/app/lib/fix-attempt-loop.js`, 11 tests in `tests/fix-attempt-loop.test.js`)
- [~] **1.2a** Cross-fix syntax-validation gate (vm.compileFunction for JS, JSON.parse for JSON; TS family pass-through pending typescript dep at the root) — **DONE commit `478b675`** (`website/app/lib/cross-fix-syntax-gate.js`, 22 tests in `tests/cross-fix-syntax-gate.test.js`)
- [~] **1.2b** Cross-file scanner re-validation — algorithm + wiring shipped in commit `(this commit)`: `website/app/lib/cross-fix-scanner-gate.js` builds a synthetic post-fix workspace, calls `runTier()` from `website/app/lib/scan-modules`, diffs against the original scan's findings, attributes new findings to specific fixes, and rolls back the offending ones. 22 tests in `tests/cross-fix-scanner-gate.test.js`. Wired into `/api/scan/fix` — gate runs ONLY when caller passes `originalFileContents` + `originalFindingsByModule`. Outstanding for "fully wired end-to-end": scan/status page needs to pass those fields into `/api/scan/fix` (admin Command Center likewise). Until that wiring lands, the gate is a no-op for production traffic — the scaffold is ready and tested but not yet active.
- [x] **1.3** Test generation per fix — **DONE commit `(this commit)`** (`website/app/lib/test-generator.js`, 33 tests in `tests/test-generator.test.js`). For every successful, gate-passed fix, Claude writes a regression test that demonstrates the original bug. Tests land at `tests/auto-generated/<flattened-path>.test.<ext>` in the same PR. Defaults to `node:test` framework; honors `frameworkHint`. Untestable fixes (config, docs, CREATE_FILE, type modules) are skipped silently. Per-fix failures never block the underlying fix from shipping.
- [x] **1.4** PR composition — **DONE commit `(this commit)`** (`website/app/lib/pr-composer.js`, 25 tests in `tests/pr-composer.test.js`). Single composer renders: header with issue/file/test counts, before/after scan-comparison table (when baseline supplied), gate results (syntax / scanner / test-gen summaries), per-file attempt-history table (each fix's outcome breakdown + Claude time), fixed-files block, regression-tests-added section, advisory section for items that didn't fix cleanly, "How GateTest works" + Next Steps + footer. Auto-generated regression tests rendered in their own section, NOT in fixed-files. Order verified by test.
- [~] **1.5** Real-repo proof: end-to-end on 3 real public repos. Output documented in `docs/proofs/phase-1-<repo>.md` with timestamps, before/after scan reports, and the actual PR diff. **Partial — 2/3 proofs shipped**: (1) `docs/proofs/phase-1-self-scan.md` documents a real `node bin/gatetest.js --suite quick` run against this repo (30/39 modules passed, 37 errors, 328 warnings, 10s wall time, blocking gate). (2) `docs/proofs/phase-1-self-fix-real.md` documents a real Claude API call exercising the iterative fix loop end-to-end on `src/runtime/alerts.js` — 1 attempt, 8.5s wall time, 2 console.log calls correctly replaced with `process.stderr.write`, syntax gate passed. Third proof (full `/api/scan/fix` route flow opening a real PR) needs either dev-server or deployed-endpoint exercise; algorithm is proven, route flow remains. Targets named in the proof docs.
- [ ] **Definition of done for this phase:** every box above ticked AND the 3 proof docs exist AND `node --test tests/*.test.js` is green.

### Phase 2 — $199 Scan + Fix tier (depth)

- [x] **2.1** Pair-review agent — **DONE commit `(this commit)`** (`website/app/lib/pair-review.js`, 33 tests in `tests/pair-review.test.js`). Second Claude reads each fix's (original → fixed) diff and the regression test, scores 4 axes 1-5 (correctness / completeness / readability / testCoverage), writes a paragraph critique. Output rendered as a PR comment via `renderReviewComment`. Wired into route — runs ONLY when `input.tier === "scan_fix"` so $99 customers don't pay for $199 work. Failures non-blocking (PR ships even if critique fails). Auto-generated regression-test files are excluded from review (reviewing the test the first Claude wrote is a different task).
- [x] **2.2** Architecture annotations — **DONE commit `(this commit)`** (`website/app/lib/architecture-annotator.js`, 33 tests in `tests/architecture-annotator.test.js`). Reads the codebase SHAPE (not per-file): top-dir counts, ext distribution, biggest files, a sample of N (default 8) most-significant files. Sends to Claude with strict-output prompt. Produces "design observations" report (Summary / Observations / Recommendations sections) — informational only, never auto-refactored. Posts as a separate PR comment via `renderArchitectureComment`. Wired into route — runs ONLY on `tier === "scan_fix"` AND when `originalFileContents` is supplied. Failures non-blocking. Skips codebases with < 3 source files. Files in `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`, `coverage/`, `vendor/`, tests, specs, and minified bundles are excluded from sampling.
- [x] **2.3** Wire `scan_fix` tier into `/api/checkout/route.ts` `TIERS` and add the card to `Pricing.tsx` — **DONE commit `(this commit)`**. Pre-authorised by the loosened Boss Rule because 2.1 + 2.2 + 2.4 all shipped with proof. Stripe `GateTest Scan + Fix` product (already in Stripe at $199 — Craig confirmed via screenshot earlier this session) now wired through. Pricing grid expanded from `md:grid-cols-2 max-w-3xl` to `md:grid-cols-3 max-w-5xl` so all three tiers render side-by-side. Card features list emphasises pair-review + architecture annotator + iterative-loop + regression-test guarantees as the differentiators over $99.
- [x] **2.4** Real-repo proof on 3 repos — **DONE 4/3 (requirement exceeded)** commit `(this commit)`. (1) `docs/proofs/phase-2-self-pair-review-and-architecture.md` — gatetest self-proof. (2) `docs/proofs/phase-2-3-crontech-real-customer-grade.md` — Crontech (754 errors, 23/39 modules pass). (3-4) `docs/proofs/phase-2-3-gluecron-marcoreid.md` — Gluecron (649 errors) + MarcoReid (124 errors, includes a critical money-float in trust-account handling). 9/9 diagnoses on each target. Correlator honestly returned 0 chains on MarcoReid (independent findings) rather than padding — integrity validated.
- [ ] Definition of done: customer can buy $199 tier and receive a measurably deeper deliverable than $99.

### Phase 3 — $399 Nuclear tier (correlation + adversarial)

- [x] **3.1** Replace ALL templated shell-command fixes with Claude-driven diagnosis — **DONE commit `(this commit)`** (`website/app/lib/nuclear-diagnoser.js`, 29 tests in `tests/nuclear-diagnoser.test.js`). Per-finding diagnoser sends each (detail, module, severity, hostname, platform context) to Claude and parses a structured response (EXPLANATION / ROOT_CAUSE / RECOMMENDATION / PLATFORM_NOTES). Replaces the category-matched template generators in `server-fix/route.ts` ONLY for the Nuclear tier — Quick/Full continue to use the legacy templates as free starter snippets (the dishonest "we know your stack" pattern only existed at Nuclear, which now branches to real diagnosis). Failures non-blocking per finding. Caps at 20 findings per request to bound Anthropic spend per call. `renderDiagnosesReport` formats the customer-visible markdown with $399-tier branded footer.
- [x] **3.2** Cross-finding correlation engine — **DONE commit `(this commit)`** (`website/app/lib/cross-finding-correlator.js`, 24 tests in `tests/cross-finding-correlator.test.js`). Reads the full findings set, identifies CHAINS where the combined severity is materially worse than the worst individual finding. Strict output schema (CHAIN / SEVERITY / INVOLVES / IMPACT / FIX_ORDER), max 5 chains, SKIP marker honest fallback when nothing combines. Validates finding numbers against bounds, rejects single-finding "chains," skips malformed blocks instead of failing the whole batch. Resolves finding numbers back to detail strings for the markdown report. Renders as `## GateTest Cross-Finding Correlation` with severity badges (🔴/🟠/🟡/⚪). Wired into the Nuclear path — runs in parallel with diagnoseFindings (independent Claude calls) for speed.
- [x] **3.3** Mutation testing pass — **DONE commit `(this commit)`**. Module shipped at `src/modules/mutation.js` (existed pre-session as a 258-line implementation). Operators extracted to a testable engine at `src/core/mutation-engine.js` (19 canonical operators: equality flips, boundary swaps, math swaps, return-value flips, increment/decrement, logical-operator swaps). 33 algorithm tests in `tests/mutation-engine.test.js` cover every operator + the `shouldSkipLine` filter + `generateMutations` orchestrator + `applyCandidate` helper. **Bug found + fixed during test build:** `return true` pattern lacked `\b` so it matched `return trueish` and produced `return falseish` nonsense — fixed with word-boundary anchors. Inline build, zero new dependencies (per Craig's Stryker-vs-inline call). Module is in the CLI's Nuclear tier (`src/core/config.js:256`). Runs locally via `gatetest --suite nuclear`; serverless-side wiring to the website's `runTier()` is future work since mutation testing requires running the customer's test suite which Vercel functions can't safely do.
- [x] **3.4** Chaos / fuzz pass — **DONE commit `(this commit)`**. Module shipped at `src/modules/chaos.js` (existed pre-session as a 281-line Playwright-based implementation). Five resilience scenarios: slow network (3G simulation), API failures, offline mode, missing resources, server timeouts. 7 real tests in `tests/chaos.test.js` cover module shape + scenario method presence + URL-resolution priority (chaos.url > explorer.url > liveCrawler.url) + Playwright-missing graceful degradation + the no-URL early-return path doesn't even attempt to require Playwright. Tests use `Module._resolveFilename` interception to simulate Playwright absence without actually uninstalling it. Inline build, zero new dependencies. Module is in the CLI's Nuclear tier (`src/core/config.js:255`). Runs locally where Playwright + a target URL are available.
- [x] **3.5** Executive summary report — **DONE commit `(this commit)`** (`website/app/lib/executive-summary.js`, 22 tests in `tests/executive-summary.test.js`). Synthesises scan stats + top findings + chains into a CTO-readable single document. 5 sections (HEADLINE / POSTURE / TOP_3_ACTIONS / WORKING_WELL / RECOMMENDED_NEXT) with strict-output schema. Renders as `# Executive Summary` markdown with subject hostname, blockquote headline, posture bullets, top-3 actions, what's working well counter-balance, recommended next step. Wired into Nuclear path AFTER parallel diagnosis + correlation — sequential because it depends on their outputs. Failures non-blocking. Output ordered in `report`: executive first (CTO read), then technical diagnosis report, then correlation report.
- [x] **3.6** Wire `nuclear` tier into `/api/checkout/route.ts` `TIERS` and add the card to `Pricing.tsx` — **DONE commit `(this commit)`**. Pre-authorised by the loosened Boss Rule because 3.1 + 3.2 + 3.3 + 3.4 + 3.5 + 3.7 all shipped with proof. Stripe `GateTest Nuclear` product exists at $399 (Craig confirmed via screenshot earlier this session). Pricing grid expanded from `md:grid-cols-3 max-w-5xl` to `md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 max-w-7xl` so all four tiers render side-by-side on large screens. Card features list emphasises real-Claude-diagnosis + cross-finding correlation + mutation testing + chaos/fuzz + executive summary as the differentiators over $199.
- [x] **3.7** Real-repo proof on 3 repos — **DONE 4/3 (requirement exceeded)** commit `(this commit)`. (1) gatetest self: 12/12 diagnosed, 4 chains incl. textbook session-forgery vector. (2) Crontech: 10/10, 2 critical chains (client-bundle exposure + supply-chain CI takeover). (3) Gluecron: 9/9, 3 chains incl. the cleverest one — *"Hardcoded secret + undeclared key in .env.example → secret rotation is impossible"* — describes operational lock-in neither finding describes alone. (4) MarcoReid: 9/9, 0 chains (correlator HONESTLY said findings independent rather than padding), but flagged real `parseFloat`-on-trust-account-money textbook fintech bug. Total Anthropic spend across all 4 proofs: ~$3-4. Margin at $399 = 100x+.
- [ ] Definition of done: customer can buy $399 tier and receive a deliverable that justifies a $399 spend (i.e. a real engineer would say "yes, that was worth $399").

### Phase 4 — Honesty sweep

- [x] **4.1** Disable any of the 90 modules that don't survive real-repo validation — **DONE no-op** (this commit). Across the four real-repo proofs (gatetest, Crontech, Gluecron, MarcoReid) every module that fired produced legitimate findings. No module crashed, no module produced obvious noise. All 90 modules load via `node bin/gatetest.js --list`. No disabling required. The sweep posture: "we looked, found no module that needed disabling, all 90 stay in their assigned tiers."
- [x] **4.2** Sweep `compare/*` pages — **DONE** (this commit). The $199 Scan + Fix mentions across all 5 compare pages (snyk, deepsource, sonarqube, eslint, github-code-scanning) are now honest because Phase 2.3 shipped. Each page's auto-fix FAQ updated with a tail clause acknowledging the $399 Nuclear tier (Claude-driven per-finding diagnosis, attack-chain correlation, mutation testing, executive summary). github-code-scanning's "Auto-fix, not just alerts" comparison row also extended.
- [x] **4.3** Update CLAUDE.md `## VERSION` to reflect post-build state — **DONE** (this commit). v1.41.0 → v1.42.0 with full FIX-FIRST BUILD PLAN summary. Also fixed Bible drift "64 modules" → "90 modules" across 8 surfaces (was lingering from earlier).
- [x] **4.4** Move resolved Known Issues out of the table — **DONE no-op** (this commit). Reviewed all 29 Known Issues; the FIX-FIRST plan didn't directly resolve any (it added new tiers, didn't fix old bugs). No table edits needed.
- [x] **Bonus — `next.config.ts` ESM `__dirname` fix** — **DONE** (this commit). Next 16 loads next.config.ts as ESM where `__dirname` is undefined. Fixed via `path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url))`.

### Operating rules during the build

1. **Pick up from the last unchecked box.** Every session reads this list, finds the first `- [ ]` box, and works it. No re-asking Craig.
2. **Commit at every meaningful milestone.** Bible's "no chicken scratchings" rule still applies — but partial-progress commits with clear messages are fine and encouraged so the next session has a clean handoff.
3. **Real-repo proof is mandatory.** No phase counts as done without the proof docs. "It compiles" is not done.
4. **Boss Rule loosened for this plan only.** Sub-tasks 2.3, 3.6, and 4.2 (the three would-be pauses) are **pre-authorised** when the preceding sub-tasks of their phase have shipped with proof artifacts and tests green. So $199 doesn't get flipped on for sale until pair-review + architecture annotations + proof docs exist; $399 doesn't get flipped on until diagnosis + correlation + mutation + chaos + report + proof docs exist; compare-page sweep doesn't run until the modules being marketed are validated. Authorisation: Craig 2026-04-26 — *"we just want you to start building from the start and carry on to finish."* Nuclear-button items (production deploys, DNS, new third-party API integrations, brand rewrites, anything touching money/user-data outside this plan) still require Craig's explicit go-ahead.
5. **Update CLAUDE.md when a phase ships.** Tick the boxes. Move the version number. Add a date.
6. **Tests stay green.** Sweep checklist runs every session. If something this plan touched broke a test, fix it before moving on.

## THE 110% MANDATE — PHASE 5 BUILD PLAN (READ THIS EVERY SESSION)

**Authorization:** Granted by Craig 2026-04-29 — *"we need to be at 110%."* Phase 5 is the move from 80-90th percentile (today's market) to 110% — beyond the theoretical ceiling of "the best AI diagnostic/fix tool ever made."

This plan supersedes "pick the next Known Issue." Every session reads this section, picks up where the previous session stopped, and continues. Boss Rule's 9 items still need Craig's go-ahead — but routine code, scaffolds, schemas, helper modules, tests, and progressive wiring within the approved stack are pre-authorised.

### The competitive thesis

Phase 1-4 made GateTest honest at 4 price tiers. Phase 5 makes GateTest **structurally impossible to catch** by anyone who isn't already running 100,000 scans of customer code. Every sub-phase below either:
- Adds a moat that compounds with usage (more customers → smarter product), or
- Closes a category that today no shipping competitor handles end-to-end.

Five sub-phases, ranked by impact × feasibility × compounding value:

### Phase 5.1 — Cross-repo intelligence (the brain)

The thing that doesn't exist anywhere else today and that compounds with every customer.

- [x] **5.1.1** Schema + storage — **DONE 2026-04-29** commit `afd9f53`. `scan_fingerprint` table in Neon with 6 indexes (time-series, repo-history, GIN on framework_versions, GIN on module_findings, tier aggregates, signature lookup). `website/app/lib/scan-fingerprint-store.js`. Privacy contract enforced by tests: cleartext repo URL is hashed before SQL binding, NO source code stored, NO file paths stored. 31 tests in `tests/scan-fingerprint-store.test.js`.
- [x] **5.1.2** Pattern fingerprint extractor — **DONE 2026-04-29** commit `a52f16f`. Pure function at `website/app/lib/scan-fingerprint.js`. Four-layer shape: framework versions, language mix (per-extension byte share), per-module {count, deduped+sorted patternHashes}, fingerprint signature (sha256 of canonical-stringified layers). Pattern hash design: (module, ruleId, file-extension) — same hash across files, same hash across repos for the same rule, different hash when language context changes. Bug found + fixed during build: my first canonical-stringify used `JSON.stringify(x, allowedKeys)` (filter form) which only keeps top-level keys and zeroed out nested objects — replaced with recursive canonical-stringify that sorts keys at every depth. 46 tests in `tests/scan-fingerprint.test.js`.
- [x] **5.1.3** Cross-repo lookup wired into nuclear diagnoser — **DONE 2026-04-29** commit `69b32d0`. `website/app/lib/cross-repo-lookup.js` (summariseSimilarScans, renderPriorArtPrompt, fetchPriorArt) + threading priorArt through nuclear-diagnoser's buildDiagnosisPrompt + diagnoseFinding + diagnoseFindings. Anti-template guard added: prompt explicitly tells Claude "Do not copy from prior-art." Defensive: returns null when sample is below MIN_SAMPLE_SIZE (3) or no module fires above 25%, never blocks the diagnoser. Bug found + fixed: percentile() off-by-one (Math.floor(p * (n-1)) → Math.floor(p * n)). 35+ tests across cross-repo-lookup + nuclear-diagnoser regression.
- [x] **5.1.4** Customer dashboard — **DONE 2026-04-29** commit `099bc02`. `/api/dashboard/intelligence` route + `/dashboard/intelligence` page. Headline 'You are X percentile' card with positioning chip (leader / above_average / median / below_average / lagging), side-by-side 'Your stack' + 'Cohort' cards with framework versions + language mix bars, module-fire-rate bars across the cohort, cohort fix-success-rate bars per module, recent similar scans table (deidentified — only frameworks + counts shown). Auth: same admin-cookie + GitHub-OAuth pattern as other admin routes. Customer-facing variant for $599 Brain tier comes when that tier's checkout wires up (Boss Rule). Type bug fixed during build: cohortStats response mixed `count` and `sampleSize` — now exposes both for UI parity. 177 tests green across all of 5.1, website builds clean.
- [~] **5.1.5** Real-repo proof on 3 stacks — **PARTIAL 2026-04-29**. Methodology + verification doc shipped at `docs/proofs/phase-5-1-brain-methodology.md` (177 tests, 6 layers, 5-rule privacy contract, synthetic-cohort verification). Three per-stack stub docs shipped: `phase-5-1-next-stripe.md`, `phase-5-1-express-pg.md`, `phase-5-1-fastapi-react.md` — each with the SQL queries, capture sections, and honest-assessment template. Stubs need to be filled in by the next session with DB + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY access. Architecture is proven; cohort population is the remaining work.
- [ ] **Definition of done:** every box ticked AND a new $599 "Brain" tier wired into Stripe + Pricing.tsx with proof that customers on Brain get measurably better diagnoses than $399 customers (FP-rate delta on the proof repos). **Stripe wire-up is Boss Rule territory** — pre-authorised when 5.1.5 ships with all three real-cohort proofs.

### Phase 5.2 — Closed feedback loop (self-improving)

Without this, the brain in 5.1 plateaus at first-day quality. With it, every customer interaction makes the next one smarter.

- [x] **5.2.1** Dissent capture (storage + UI hooks) — **DONE 2026-04-29** commits `ddb61cf` (storage) + `101b26a` (UI hooks). `website/app/lib/dissent-store.js` with 4-index schema, 5-kind enum (ROLLED_BACK / PR_CLOSED_UNMERGED / FALSE_POSITIVE / FIX_REJECTED / COMMENT_DOWNVOTE), helpers for record / aggregate-by-module-pattern / list-for-repo / kinds-summary. POST `/api/dissent` route (admin-auth, idempotent table init, kind-enum validation). FindingsPanel thumbs-down button per-finding with idle/pending/recorded states. `/api/scan/fix` rollback hook records FIX_REJECTED on every cross-file-scanner-gate rollback. Privacy contract enforced by tests: cleartext URL never reaches SQL, reviewer identity hashed case-insensitively, notes capped at 500 chars, kind enum frozen. 27 tests in `tests/dissent-store.test.js`.
- [x] **5.2.2** Per-module FP scorer + cron — **DONE 2026-04-29** commit `2c4370b`. `website/app/lib/module-confidence.js` with deterministic `computeConfidenceScore` (base × spread × volumeFloor + fixSuccessBonus, all clamped to [0,1]) + recommendedAction (trust/downgrade/double-down/suppress at 0.85/0.65/0.45 thresholds) + module_confidence table (UNIQUE on (module, pattern_hash), partial index on score < 0.65) + ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE upsert + getConfidenceScore with (module, pattern_hash) → (module, NULL) fallback + refreshModuleConfidence cron entry-point. POST `/api/admin/learning/refresh` (manual operator trigger), GET `/api/admin/learning/refresh` (last-refresh stats), GET `/api/admin/learning/cron` (Vercel-cron entry, weekly `0 6 * * 1`). 26 tests in `tests/module-confidence.test.js` covering scoring math, clamp behaviour, action thresholds, storage idempotence, refresh flow.
- [x] **5.2.3** Confidence-aware reporting — **DONE 2026-04-29** commit `4018a83`. `website/app/lib/confidence-aware-report.js` with SEVERITY_TRANSFORM table per action, classifySeverity (mirrors ai-handoff.js heuristic), reprefixSeverity (idempotent severity rewrite), applyConfidenceToModule (per-module transform with full suppressed[] + downgraded[] audit trail), applyConfidenceToScan (scan-level wrapper, recomputes totalIssues), buildResolveAction (cached closure, falls through on error). Wired into `/api/scan/run` after `runTier` completes — looks up each module's action via cached resolver, transforms severities, includes confidenceAdjustments:{suppressed,downgraded} in response. Best-effort: brain outage falls through with original modules. 21 tests in `tests/confidence-aware-report.test.js`.
- [x] **5.2.4** Operator dashboard — **DONE 2026-04-29** commit `d738af8`. GET `/api/admin/learning` returns trackedModules (50 lowest-score), kindsBreakdown (30d window), aggregateDissentByModulePattern, recentDissent (50). `/admin/learning` page with headline stats (Modules tracked / Lowest score / Highest score / Dissent 30d), manual 'Refresh confidence' button, kinds-breakdown horizontal bars, tracked-modules table sorted ascending by score (worst rises first), recent dissent events table. Pattern matches `/dashboard/intelligence` (5.1.4). Auth: same admin-cookie + GitHub-OAuth.
- [~] **5.2.5** Real-cohort proof — **PARTIAL 2026-04-29**. Methodology + verification doc shipped at `docs/proofs/phase-5-2-feedback-loop-methodology.md`. Three per-module stub docs shipped: `phase-5-2-lint-noisy-module.md`, `phase-5-2-secrets-medium-noise.md`, `phase-5-2-syntax-low-noise.md` (the third is the integrity check — confirms the scorer leaves low-noise modules alone). Stubs need to be filled in by the next session with ≥30 dissent events accumulated. Architecture is proven; dissent volume is the remaining work.
- [ ] **Definition of done:** every box ticked AND a published metric in `/admin/learning` showing FP rate trending down over time. (Awaits real customer dissent volume.)

### Phase 5.3 — Live observability fusion

Static + runtime + production = the killer triangle. Every other tool gives you 1 of 3.

- [x] **5.3.1** Sentry integration — **DONE 2026-04-29** commit `17869ae`. Dormant-ready: ships fully tested; goes live when Craig adds SENTRY_CLIENT_ID + SENTRY_CLIENT_SECRET. `website/app/lib/external-integrations-store.js` (polymorphic store for ALL of 5.3, AES-256-GCM token encryption with INTEGRATIONS_SECRET key, fail-closed if secret < 32 chars), `website/app/lib/sentry-client.js` (OAuth code-exchange + fetchTopErrors + frame extraction with metadata.in_app_frames → metadata.frames → culprit fallback). OAuth routes: `/api/integrations/sentry/connect` (CSRF state cookie + redirect to sentry.io/oauth/authorize) + `/api/integrations/sentry/callback` (state verify, code exchange, encrypted token store). 24 + 19 = 43 new tests including PRIVACY CONTRACT suite that fails if cleartext tokens leak into SQL values.
- [ ] **5.3.2** Datadog integration — same pattern, pulls APM trace samples for top error endpoints.
- [ ] **5.3.3** Vercel Analytics integration — pulls page-load + serverless-function p95 latencies + error rates per route.
- [ ] **5.3.4** Static-finding ↔ runtime correlator — when a scan finds an issue at `src/api/checkout.ts:42`, cross-reference Sentry/Datadog: did this exact line throw in prod last 7 days? If yes, finding gets a `🔥 LIVE` badge and jumps to top of priority. Pure function, 20+ unit tests with mocked observability data.
- [ ] **5.3.5** Real-repo proof — pick a customer codebase with a live Sentry account, show 3 findings that matched real prod errors. Document in `docs/proofs/phase-5-3-live-fusion.md`.
- [ ] **Definition of done:** every box ticked AND a $799 "Production" tier wired into Stripe + Pricing.tsx — pricing reflects the cost-saving of catching ACTIVE prod bugs faster than a runtime APM alone.

### Phase 5.4 — Architectural surgery (multi-file refactors)

The architecture annotator (Phase 2.2) reports — Phase 5.4 acts. Three canonical refactors, then expand.

- [ ] **5.4.1** Refactor framework — same iterative-loop + 3-gate pipeline that powers per-file fixes, generalised to multi-file plans. Plan-then-apply: Claude proposes a 50-file diff, every file passes syntax gate + scanner gate + test-gen, then bundled into one PR. Hard time-budget for the planning phase (90s) + execution phase (240s).
- [ ] **5.4.2** Canonical refactor #1: **polling → webhook**. Detects polling patterns (interval-based GETs to internal services), proposes webhook-driven equivalent, generates the webhook receiver + sender + tests. Single most-common refactor in modern codebases.
- [ ] **5.4.3** Canonical refactor #2: **in-memory state → external store**. Detects `Map`/`Set`/`Object` global state on serverless paths, proposes Vercel KV / Redis / Postgres equivalent + migration path.
- [ ] **5.4.4** Canonical refactor #3: **monolithic API route → typed client**. Detects untyped fetch calls, generates a typed client + zod schemas + updates every call site. Pairs naturally with Phase 5.5 cross-language semantics.
- [ ] **5.4.5** Real-repo proof — pick 3 real codebases, ship one canonical refactor each as a real PR. Document in `docs/proofs/phase-5-4-architecture-<refactor>.md`.
- [ ] **Definition of done:** every box ticked AND a $999 "Refactor" tier wired into Stripe + Pricing.tsx — priced to reflect "1 senior engineer × 3 days" replaced by "1 Nuclear scan + 1 GateTest refactor."

### Phase 5.5 — Cross-language unified semantics

The OpenAPI-drift module is the seed. Make the contract graph the centre of everything.

- [ ] **5.5.1** Contract harvester — extends openapi-drift to also harvest GraphQL schemas (`*.graphql`, `*.gql`), protobuf (`*.proto`), tRPC routers, JSON Schema, and Zod schemas. Builds a unified contract graph: { contract_id, type, version, producers[], consumers[] }.
- [ ] **5.5.2** Contract-drift detector — given the graph, detects: producer changes a field type that consumer depends on; consumer reads a field producer doesn't expose; version skew across services. New module `contractDrift` registered in TIERS.
- [ ] **5.5.3** Cross-service taint — extends the existing cross-file-taint engine across language boundaries by following contract edges. JS frontend calls Python API → tracks taint into the Python handler.
- [ ] **5.5.4** Visual contract map — `/dashboard/contracts` renders the graph as an interactive force-directed visualization. Customers see their entire system as one graph, click any edge to see the drift status.
- [ ] **5.5.5** Real-repo proof — pick a polyglot repo (e.g. Next.js frontend + Python backend), introduce a deliberate contract drift, show GateTest catches it before it reaches CI. Document in `docs/proofs/phase-5-5-contract-drift.md`.
- [ ] **Definition of done:** every box ticked AND `contractDrift` module loads via `node bin/gatetest.js --list` AND the visual map renders cleanly on a real polyglot repo.

### Cross-cutting Phase 5 deliverables

These ride alongside every sub-phase, not after:

- **Tier expansion:** $29 / $99 / $199 / $399 / **$599 (Brain) / $799 (Production) / $999 (Refactor)**. Boss Rule applies on each Stripe wire-up, but the build is pre-authorised.
- **Module count target:** 90 → 100+ as Phase 5.5 ships new modules (contractDrift, prodCorrelator, fingerprintMatcher, etc.).
- **Test count target:** 1300+ → 2000+ as new helpers ship with proportional test coverage.
- **Proof artifact target:** 3 proofs per sub-phase = 15 new files under `docs/proofs/phase-5-*/`.

### Operating rules during Phase 5

1. **Pick up from the last unchecked box.** Sessions read this list, find the first `- [ ]`, work it.
2. **Commit at every meaningful milestone.** Bible's "no chicken scratchings" still applies — partial-progress commits with clear messages are encouraged so the next session has a clean handoff.
3. **Real-repo proof is mandatory.** No sub-phase counts as done without the proof docs.
4. **Boss Rule loosened for this plan.** Each tier's Stripe wire-up is pre-authorised when the preceding sub-tasks ship with proof. Nuclear-button items (DNS, new external API integrations beyond OAuth pattern, brand rewrites, money/user-data outside this plan) still require Craig's explicit go-ahead.
5. **Update CLAUDE.md when a phase ships.** Tick the boxes. Move the version number. Add a date.
6. **Tests stay green.** Sweep checklist runs every session.

## PHASE 6 — THE 100-MOVES MASTER PLAN (READ THIS EVERY SESSION)

**Authorization:** Granted by Craig 2026-04-30 — *"Lets do it"* in response to the brutal-honest 100-move list. This plan supersedes "pick the next thing." Every session reads this section, finds the first unchecked Tier 1 item, ships it, then continues into Tier 2/3/4 as Tier 1 closes.

### The competitive thesis

Phase 5 was the move from on-spec ($29-$399 honest delivery) to 110% (cross-repo brain, closed feedback loop, observability fusion, multi-file refactors, cross-language semantics). Phase 6 is the move from "best AI diagnostic/fix tool" to **the platform every developer eventually uses** — distribution, ecosystem, compliance, language depth, AI-app safety, supply-chain trust, and the brutal moats only GateTest can build.

100 items, organised in 8 tiers. Tier 1-2 = ~25 items = best-in-class for sale. Tiers 3-4 = +45 items = uncatchable in the market. Tiers 5-8 = +30 items = category, not product.

### Tier 1 — Launch-essential (1-10): the credibility floor

- [x] **6.1.1** Couple Nuclear diagnoser → fix loop — **DONE 2026-04-30** commit `ca62637`. `website/app/lib/diagnosis-enricher.js` runs diagnoseFindings against fix issues at tier=nuclear, prepends rootCause + recommendation + platformNotes to each issue text BEFORE the fix loop sees it. 21 enricher tests + 8 reliability tests.
- [x] **6.1.2** Per-finding fix preview + selection UI — **DONE 2026-04-30** commit `(this commit)`. New `<FixSelectionPanel>` component sits between FindingsPanel and AIBuilderHandoff on `/scan/status`. Three layers of selection control: header chips (all-fixable / errors-only / warnings-only / clear), per-module quick-select, per-finding checkbox grid grouped by file with indeterminate-state file-level toggles. Pure-function backing helper `selectable-findings.js` with 32 tests covers parser, severity classifier, group-by-file, count summaries, filter→selection, selection→IssueInput[] conversion, and CTA-label rendering. `runFixWithIssues(issues)` route handler in `/scan/status/page.tsx` accepts the partial subset and threads tier through (so $399 nuclear coupling still fires). Honest documented limitation: bare ".gitignore" findings stay unfixable (regex needs path-prefix shape) — surfaced in the "manual" bucket of the panel.
- [x] **6.1.3** Inline before/after diff in every report — **DONE 2026-04-30** commit `(this commit)`. Pure-function `inline-diff.js` (LCS-based line-diff, 1-indexed hunks matching `diff -u` convention, 5000-line cap with graceful oversize fallback, 29 tests covering identical-input/oversize/context-merging/determinism). New `<DiffViewer>` component renders hunks side-by-side with red-`-` / green-`+` highlighting, file-level expand/collapse (auto-collapse when >3 files), per-fix issue context list, inline CopyButton for the unified-diff text. Wired into `/scan/status` PR-success block as a `<details>` block — customers see the patches BEFORE clicking through to GitHub. `/api/scan/fix` now returns `before`/`after` content per fix (capped at 200KB per side to stay under Vercel's 4.5MB response ceiling).
- [x] **6.1.4** Universal copy-everywhere — **DONE 2026-04-30** commit `(this commit)`. New `<CopyButton>` component (icon/label/inline variants) + shared `copy-formatters.js` helper. Wired into FindingsPanel (per-finding rows + bulk-header markdown checklist) and LiveScanTerminal (full-transcript copy). 20 formatter tests, modern clipboard API + textarea fallback for older browsers / iframe contexts.
- [x] **6.1.5** Fix-loop reliability test in CI — **DONE 2026-04-30** commit `ca62637`. `tests/fix-loop-reliability.test.js` fails the build if `attemptFixWithRetries` ever silently returns success=false on deterministic happy-path input. Catches the "0 done · 14 retry" bug shape before it ships.
- [ ] **6.1.6** Hero + landing-page facelift — drop the all-black hero, gradient flow into the rest of the page, lighter weight. ~1 day. Boss Rule (#8 brand) — needs Craig's mock approval before push.
- [ ] **6.1.7** GitHub Marketplace listing live — distribution is the bottleneck. 2-3 hr listing-prep + 2-3 week GitHub approval. Boss Rule (#8 public-facing comms). I draft copy + screenshots; Craig submits.
- [ ] **6.1.8** Apple Pay / Google Pay activated in Stripe Dashboard — wallet-first checkout. ~2 min Craig action. Code already supports it (commit `854244c`).
- [ ] **6.1.9** First 10 paying customers — sales not engineering. HN / Twitter DMs / OSS-maintainer outreach / Crontech & Gluecron customer offers / Product Hunt launch.
- [ ] **6.1.10** Public "fixed by GateTest" registry — every shipped PR publicly logged at `gatetest.ai/fixes` as proof. Marketing flywheel.

### Tier 2 — Compounding moats (11-25): uncatchable in 6 months

- [ ] **6.2.1** Phase 5.4 multi-file architectural refactor pipeline (polling→webhook, in-memory→Redis, untyped→typed-client). 1-2 weeks. Single highest-leverage move for the $999 tier.
- [ ] **6.2.2** Cross-repo intelligence cohort population — 30-min Craig action: scan 10 popular Next/Stripe + Express/pg + FastAPI/React repos to seed the brain.
- [ ] **6.2.3** Phase 5.3.2 + 5.3.3 + 5.3.4 — Datadog + Vercel Analytics + static↔runtime correlator. Killer feature for $799 Production tier.
- [ ] **6.2.4** Phase 5.5 cross-language contract graph — JS↔Python↔Rust as ONE program. Polyglot drift detection no competitor has.
- [x] **6.2.5** Closed-feedback FP-rate trending in `/admin/learning` — **DONE 2026-04-30** commit `(this commit)`. Pure-function `fp-trend.js` (bucketKeyFor + bucketDissentRows + computeFpRateTrend + summariseTrend, deterministic, frozen-now-aware for tests, fills empty buckets so chart has no gaps). 20 tests covering bucket-key snapping, fill-empty-window, distinct-repos counting, "improving/regressing/flat/no-data/insufficient-data" headline classification, determinism. New `/api/admin/learning/trend` route (admin-auth, default 90d window with 7d buckets, query-param overrides). `/admin/learning` page gets a "FP-rate trend" Card above the kinds breakdown — headline "↓ N% FP rate improved" with arrow + tone (emerald/amber/foreground) + range + dissent-event count, plus a pure-CSS bar+overlay chart (no chart-library dep). Hover shows date · dissent count · FP% · distinct repos.
- [ ] **6.2.6** Layer-3 Operator (autonomous overnight Claude) — Vercel cron picks up Phase 5/6 boxes 24/7. Boss Rule for budget cap + kill switch.
- [x] **6.2.7** Property-based test generation per fix — **DONE 2026-04-30** commit `(this commit)`. New `property-test-generator.js` mirrors `test-generator.js` shape but emits PROPERTY tests (fast-check for JS/TS, hypothesis for Python) alongside the regression tests. Per-language prompt with explicit asks for 2-5 properties covering type-shape invariants, idempotency, boundary cases (empty/large/unicode/negative). Sanity-checks Claude's output references the property lib (rejects bare smoke tests). Output filename `tests/auto-generated/<flat>.prop.<ext>` so it sits alongside regression tests without colliding. Wired into `/api/scan/fix` ONLY when `tier === "nuclear"` (\$99/\$199 customers don't pay for the extra spend). Non-blocking — any failure logs into errors[] and ships the fix anyway. Skip-reasons surface as `(info)` rather than failures since property tests are bonus. 28 tests covering testability gate, language detection, path generation, prompt shape (JS + Python), Claude-throw resilience, fence stripping, mixed-batch behaviour, maxFixes cap with "deferred" summary line.
- [x] **6.2.8** Mutation-test-driven test strengthening — **DONE 2026-04-30** commit `(this commit)`. New `mutation-driven-test-strengthener.js` takes each (fix, regression test) pair, generates mutation candidates against the fixed source via an inlined 12-operator mutation engine (eq-flip / neq-flip / boundary swaps / math swaps / true-false / logical-op swaps / inc-dec — minimal subset of `src/core/mutation-engine.js` mirrored into the website tree because Turbopack root is locked to /website), feeds the mutations + the regression test to Claude with an explicit "your strengthened test must FAIL on each mutation but PASS on the fixed source" ask. Replaces the weak regression test in-place BEFORE the fix-list loop appends it, so the PR ships the strong version. Wired into `/api/scan/fix` ONLY when `tier === "nuclear"` AND `testGen.tests.length > 0` ($99/$199 don't pay for the strengthening pass). Non-blocking — any failure leaves the original test intact and skip-reasons surface as `(info)` errors. 29 tests covering eligibility gate, mutation engine inlined operators (12), prompt shape, Claude SKIP / identical / no-assertions / fence-stripping / throw-resilience paths, and batch maxFixes=5 cap with "deferred" summary.
- [x] **6.2.9** Chaos-test-driven resilience fixes — **DONE 2026-04-30** commit `(this commit)`. New `chaos-test-generator.js` mirrors prior generators' shape but emits `node:test` files that mock `globalThis.fetch` / `setTimeout` / `fs` to inject failures (slow network, dropped responses, timeouts, intermittent errors, partial JSON) and assert the fix degrades gracefully — retries, backs off, returns a sensible fallback. Resilience-relevance heuristic tests for fetch / axios / got / await / Promise / setTimeout / fs / WebSocket / DB-shaped calls (18 patterns); pure-data sources skip silently. Output sanity-checked: must use a recognised test runner AND must include actual failure injection (mock / stub / throw / timer override) — bare smoke tests rejected. Wired into `/api/scan/fix` Nuclear-tier only ($99/$199 don't pay). Filename `tests/auto-generated/chaos/<flat>.chaos.<ext>` so it's separate from regression / property / benchmark surfaces. 28 tests covering heuristic positives across 5 resilience classes + benchmarkability gate + path generation + prompt shape + Claude SKIP / no-runner / no-failure-injection / fence-stripping / throw-resilience + batch maxFixes=4 cap with "deferred" summary.
- [x] **6.2.10** Performance benchmark before/after on every PR — **DONE 2026-04-30** commit `(this commit)`. New `perf-benchmark-generator.js` mirrors prior generators' shape but emits `tinybench` benchmark files for fixes that touch hot paths. Hot-path heuristic tests for loops / await / Promise / array-method / regex / fetch / DB-shaped calls (16 patterns) — pure-constants files correctly skip. Generated benchmark inlines BOTH original and fixed implementations as `originalFn` / `fixedFn` so it runs without before/after import resolution; asks for ≥2 input sizes (small + large) so complexity differences surface. Output sanity-checked: must include `tinybench` import OR `new Bench(` (regex tightened so a comment "// no Bench" doesn't false-pass), AND must include both fn names. Wired into `/api/scan/fix` Nuclear-tier only ($99/$199 don't pay). Filename `tests/auto-generated/benchmarks/<flat>.bench.<ext>` so it's separate from the regression-test + property-test surfaces. 32 tests covering heuristic positives/negatives across 9 hot-path classes + benchmarkability gate + path generation + prompt shape + Claude SKIP / lacking-tinybench / lacking-fn-names / fence-stripping / throw-resilience + batch maxFixes=5 cap with "deferred" summary.
- [x] **6.2.11** Dependency-upgrade + breaking-change patcher — **DONE 2026-05-05** commit `870d271`. New `website/app/lib/dependency-upgrade-patcher.js` automates the full loop: detect major-version gaps (parseMajor + findMajorUpgrades), ask Claude for BREAKING API changes, scan every source file for dep references (fileReferencesDep regex covers import/require/dynamic-import), ask Claude to patch each call site, run the cross-fix syntax gate (pickChecker — JS/JSON only, TypeScript is pass-through since we can't run tsc without the customer's config), roll back on gate failure so no broken code ships. Hard caps: MAX_DEPS_PER_RUN=3, MAX_FILES_PER_DEP=10, MAX_FILE_BYTES=80KB. Per-dep failures caught in errors[] — never block other deps. renderUpgradeSummary produces a PR comment with breaking-changes list + patched files per dep. 50 tests in `tests/dependency-upgrade-patcher.test.js` across 9 describe blocks. Designed to run inside `/api/scan/fix` at Nuclear tier only.
- [x] **6.2.12** Test coverage backfill — **DONE 2026-05-05** commit `2bf0475`. New `website/app/lib/coverage-backfill-generator.js` automates the "already fine, just untested" problem: given a list of source files, filters to candidates with no associated test file (isBackfillable + hasCoverage), asks Claude to write comprehensive test suites covering every export — happy paths + edge cases. Hard caps: MAX_FILES_PER_RUN=5, MAX_FILE_BYTES=60KB. Output at `tests/auto-generated/backfill/<flattened>.test.js`. SKIP marker honoured (untestable modules silently skipped vs. failed). Per-file Claude errors captured in errors[] without blocking other files. Validates Claude's output: minimum length, correct framework reference, actual assertions — rejects bare smoke tests. Code-fences stripped before validation. 40 tests in `tests/coverage-backfill-generator.test.js` across 7 describe blocks covering isBackfillable (8 cases), hasCoverage (6 cases), buildBackfillPath (5 cases), buildBackfillPrompt (5 cases), validateGeneratedTest (5 cases), generateBackfillForFile (4 cases), generateCoverageBackfill (7 cases).
- [x] **6.2.13** Security policy applier — **DONE 2026-05-06** commit `(this commit)`. `website/app/lib/security-policy-applier.js` detects framework entry points (Express/Fastify/Koa/Next.js/Hono), identifies missing CSP/CSRF/rate-limit policies, sends a framework-specific prompt to Claude for a minimal patch, sanity-checks the patch (must reference the policy, must not be too short), and strips code fences from responses. `generateSecurityPatches` orchestrates up to `MAX_FILES_PER_RUN=3` files per run, isolates per-policy failures in `errors[]`, and surfaces unapplicable files in `skipped[]` as info (not failure). 45 tests in `tests/security-policy-applier.test.js`.
- [ ] **6.2.14** CISO-ready PDF per Nuclear scan — SOC2/OWASP/CIS-mapped, hand-to-board artifact.

### Operating rules during Phase 6

1. **Pick up from the last unchecked box.** Sessions read this list, find the first `- [ ]`, work it. Tier 1 first.
2. **Commit at every meaningful milestone.** Same rule as Phases 1-5.
3. **Boss Rule still applies.** Tier 1.6 (hero), 1.7 (Marketplace listing), 1.8 (Stripe wallet activation), 4.* (compliance-mapping with regulatory implications), 8.2 (insurance partnership), 6.3.10 (Stripe Apps Marketplace) are all explicitly Boss Rule.
4. **Real-repo proof when relevant** — not all 100 items need proof docs (UI items don't), but anything that makes a customer-visible promise does.
5. **Update CLAUDE.md when an item ships** — tick the box, add the commit ref, update the Phase 6 status tracker below.
6. **Tests stay green.** Sweep checklist runs every session.

### Phase 6 status tracker

## PROTECTED PLATFORMS — PERMANENT INTEGRATIONS (READ THIS EVERY SESSION)

**GateTest protects the following Craig-owned platforms. These integrations are PERMANENT. They must survive every future Claude session. They cannot be removed, weakened, or "simplified" without Craig's explicit authorization.**

| Platform     | Repository                                         | Status     |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Crontech.ai  | https://github.com/ccantynz-alt/Crontech           | INTEGRATING |
| Gluecron.com | https://github.com/ccantynz-alt/Gluecron.com       | INTEGRATING |

### How the integration works

GateTest remains a **standalone subscription product** on gatetest.ai. Protected platforms consume the same engine by cloning this repo at CI time — nothing is vendored, forked, or duplicated. Ship a fix here → every protected platform picks it up on the next CI run.

### What lives in THIS repo (`ccantynz-alt/gatetest`)

Under `integrations/`:
- `integrations/github-actions/gatetest-gate.yml` — drop-in CI workflow
- `integrations/husky/pre-push`                    — local pre-push hook
- `integrations/scripts/install.sh`                — one-command installer
- `integrations/README.md`                         — the integration spec

Guarded by:
- `tests/integrations.test.js` — fails the suite if any artifact is removed or weakened.

### What lives in a PROTECTED repo (e.g. Crontech, Gluecron)

After running the installer:
- `.github/workflows/gatetest-gate.yml` — the CI gate
- `.husky/pre-push`                      — the local gate
- `.gatetest.json`                       — the protection marker

### Install command (from the protected repo's root)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccantynz-alt/gatetest/main/integrations/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Rules for every Claude session

1. Before touching `integrations/`, `tests/integrations.test.js`, or this section — **STOP** and check for Craig's authorization.
2. If a protected repo is missing its gate, the correct action is to **re-install**, never to remove the marker.
3. If `tests/integrations.test.js` fails, a previous session broke protection. **Restore it, do not delete the test.**
4. Adding a new protected platform: update the table above **and** add its repo to the installer docs.

---

## THE MISSION

Build the most advanced, most aggressive, most beautiful QA testing platform ever made. 90 modules. One gate. One decision. AI-powered code review that no competitor can match. Pay-on-completion pricing that eliminates customer risk. A scan experience so visually stunning that customers WANT to watch it run.

**The customer sees:** Their repo scanned by 90 modules in real time. Issues found. Issues fixed. Delivered.
**The competition sees:** A force they cannot match without rebuilding from scratch.
**Craig sees:** Recurring revenue with high margins on a moat that compounds over time.

---

## THE AGGRESSIVE STACK

Every tool here was chosen because it is the **best in its class right now.** If something better emerges, we replace it without sentiment.

### Core Engine
| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Runtime** | Node.js 20+ | Zero dependencies, runs anywhere |
| **Language** | JavaScript (core) + TypeScript (website) | Fast iteration, universal |
| **Architecture** | Module system extending BaseModule | Every check is a self-contained module |
| **Runner** | EventEmitter-based with severity levels | error/warning/info, parallel execution, auto-fix |
| **Reporters** | 5 formats (Console, JSON, HTML, SARIF, JUnit) | Covers every CI/CD system |

### Website & Frontend
| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Framework** | Next.js 16 (App Router) | Latest, fastest, Vercel-native |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS 4 | Utility-first, dark theme, zero unused CSS |
| **Hosting** | Vercel | Auto-deploy from main, serverless |
| **Domain** | gatetest.ai | Secured |

### Payments
| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Billing** | Stripe | Hold-then-charge via Payment Intents with manual capture |
| **Model** | Pay on completion | Customer only charged after scan delivers |

### AI Layer
| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **AI Code Review** | Claude API (Anthropic) | Best reasoning, finds real bugs not patterns |
| **Model** | claude-sonnet-4-20250514 | Fast, accurate, cost-effective |

### GitHub Integration
| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **GitHub App** | GateTestHQ | Auto-scan on push/PR, commit statuses, PR comments |
| **Auth** | JWT (RS256) from .pem private key | Standard GitHub App auth |
| **Access** | Resilient bridge with retry, circuit breaker, multi-strategy | Never fails on 503 |

---

## THE AGGRESSIVE ARCHITECTURE

### Scan Flow (Direct — No Webhooks)
```
Customer pays → Redirect to /scan/status → Page calls /api/scan/run →
Scan reads repo via GitHub API → Runs all module checks → Returns result →
Updates Stripe metadata → Captures payment → Customer sees results
```
**ONE call. ONE response. No polling. No webhooks. No shared state.**

### GitHub App Flow
```
Developer pushes code → GitHub sends webhook → /api/webhook receives →
JWT auth → Read repo via API → Run checks → Post commit status + PR comment
```

### Module Architecture
```
BaseModule (abstract)
  └── Every module extends this
  └── run(result, config) → adds checks with severity
  └── Registered in src/core/registry.js
  └── Added to suites in src/core/config.js
```

### Serverless Rules (Vercel)
- **NO in-memory state between requests** — every function is stateless
- **NO long-running async after response** — Vercel kills the function
- **NO shared memory between function instances** — use external storage
- **ALL scan work completes WITHIN the function response**
- **Stripe metadata is the persistence layer** for scan results

## THE FORBIDDEN LIST

**NEVER do these things. Ever. Without exception:**

1. **Never ship code that "compiles but doesn't work."** "It compiles" is not testing.
2. **Never use in-memory storage on Vercel serverless.** Functions don't share memory.
3. **Never depend on webhooks for critical user flows.** Direct API calls only.
4. **Never let the scan page sit at 0% or loop.** Every state must be handled.
5. **Never test with live Stripe keys.** Test keys only. Card 4242 4242 4242 4242.
6. **Never commit secrets.** Env vars only.
7. **Never skip tests for "speed."** Untested code does not exist.
8. **Never say "it's ready" without testing the actual user flow.** Click every button.
9. **Never patch symptoms.** Find and fix the root cause.
10. **Never make chicken scratchings.** Go big or go home.
11. **Never deploy to production without Craig's authorization.**
12. **Never modify Stripe configuration without Craig's authorization.**
13. **Never add a dependency not in the approved stack without authorization.**
14. **Never delete user data without explicit user action.**
15. **Never let an error bubble unhandled to the user.** Wrap, log, recover.
16. **Never silently fail.** Errors are visible.
17. **Never ship a feature without updating this file.**
18. **Never approve something you didn't test end-to-end.**
19. **Never build an 80s website.** We are AI builders. The output must be stunning.
20. **Never ask Craig "do you want me to fix this?"** If it's broken, FIX IT.
21. **Never delete, rename, or weaken `integrations/`** — that directory protects Crontech and Gluecron. See **PROTECTED PLATFORMS**.
22. **Never delete or weaken `tests/integrations.test.js`** — it is the tripwire that keeps protection intact across sessions.
23. **Never remove the PROTECTED PLATFORMS section from this file.** It must be read at every session start.
24. **Never soft-fail the gate** with `continue-on-error: true` on the GateTest step itself.

---

## PRE-BUILD CHECKLIST (BEFORE EVERY BUILD)

Before writing a single line of new code:

1. Read the relevant section of this CLAUDE.md
2. Confirm the task aligns with the build plan
3. Confirm it doesn't require Craig's authorization
4. Confirm existing patterns to follow (check similar files)
5. Confirm dependencies are in the approved stack
6. Identify which tests need to be added
7. Plan the commit message in advance

---

## POST-BUILD CHECKLIST (BEFORE COMMITTING)

After writing the code:

1. `node --test tests/*.test.js` — ALL pass
2. `cd website && npx next build` — ZERO errors
3. `node bin/gatetest.js --list` — all 90 modules load
4. No `console.log` left in library code
5. Every new route/page works (actually click it)
6. Every user flow tested end-to-end (not just "it compiles")
7. CLAUDE.md updated if anything changed
8. Conventional commit message ready
9. Push to main

---

## GATE RULES — NON-NEGOTIABLE

1. **ZERO TOLERANCE**: Any error-severity check failure blocks the pipeline. No exceptions.
2. **NO MANUAL OVERRIDES**: Checks pass or the build is rejected. Craig only.
3. **NO PARTIAL DEPLOYS**: Everything passes or nothing ships.
4. **EVIDENCE REQUIRED**: Every gate pass produces a timestamped report.
5. **TEST THE TESTS**: Mutation testing validates tests catch bugs.
6. **FIX IMMEDIATELY**: If it's broken, fix it. Don't ask. Don't wait.
7. **ROOT CAUSE ONLY**: Never patch symptoms. Find and fix the real problem.
8. **END-TO-END VERIFICATION**: "It compiles" is not testing. Click every button.

## FAILURE RESPONSE PROTOCOL

When something breaks:

1. **STOP** — Do not proceed with other work
2. **IDENTIFY** — What exactly failed? Which file? Which line? What state?
3. **ROOT CAUSE** — Why did it fail? Not the symptom. The CAUSE.
4. **FIX** — Fix the root cause, not the symptom
5. **VERIFY** — Test the fix end-to-end. Actually use it.
6. **ENSURE NO REGRESSIONS** — Run all tests. Build website. Load modules.
7. **COMMIT** — Push the fix immediately
8. **NEVER ask Craig "should I fix this?"** — YES. ALWAYS. FIX IT.

| `src/modules/dead-code.js` | Dead code — unused JS/TS/Python exports, orphaned files (nothing imports them), 10+ line commented-out code blocks; respects Next.js route conventions (page/layout/route, robots, sitemap, opengraph-image) and segment config (`dynamic`, `revalidate`, `runtime`, `maxDuration`) | Adding entry-point conventions or framework-reserved export names |
| `src/modules/secret-rotation.js` | Secret rotation — credential-shaped strings dated via `git log --format=%at` (error > 90 days, warning > 30 days), `.env` ↔ `.env.example` drift, placeholder values in `.env.example` that still match a real credential shape. Detects AKIA/ASIA, GitHub PAT/OAuth/server/fine-grained, Stripe live/restricted, Slack, Google, Anthropic, private keys, JWTs | Adding credential shapes or rotation windows |
| `src/modules/web-headers.js` | Web headers + CORS — reads next.config.{js,mjs,ts}, vercel.json, netlify.toml, _headers, nginx.conf, and Express/Fastify source. Flags CSP `unsafe-eval` (error) / `unsafe-inline` (warning), wildcard CORS origin + credentials:true (error), HSTS max-age below 180 days, missing CSP / HSTS / X-Frame-Options (or CSP frame-ancestors) / X-Content-Type-Options | Adding server-side header APIs or deploy targets |
| `src/modules/typescript-strictness.js` | TypeScript strictness — walks `tsconfig.json` / `tsconfig.*.json` (JSONC-aware, string-safe comment stripper), flags `strict: false` (error), `noImplicitAny: false` (error), `skipLibCheck: true` / `strictNullChecks: false` / `strictFunctionTypes: false` (warning); scans `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.mts`/`.cts` sources for `@ts-nocheck` (error), unreasoned `@ts-ignore` / `@ts-expect-error` (warning), exported signatures with `: any`, and `as any` casts. `*.test.ts`/`*.spec.ts` and `*.d.ts` are allowed to use `any`; `tsconfig.test.json` is allowed to relax strictness | Adding new suppression directives or tsconfig flags |
| `src/modules/flaky-tests.js` | Flaky-test detector — scans `*.test.*` / `*.spec.*` and files under `tests/`, `__tests__/`, `spec/`. Flags committed `.only` / `fit` / `fdescribe` (error), `.skip` / `xit` / `xtest` (warning, string-aware so diff-fixtures don't false-positive), `.todo` with no issue link (info), `Math.random()` (warning), `Date.now()` / `new Date()` with no `useFakeTimers` in the file (warning), real `fetch`/`axios`/`http.request` calls with no `nock`/`msw`/`vi.mock` (warning), `setTimeout`/`setInterval` without fake timers (warning), `process.env.X = ...` without a matching `afterEach` restore or `delete` (warning), test titles containing "flaky"/"intermittent"/"sometimes" (warning) | Adding new test-framework shapes or mock libraries |
| `src/modules/error-swallow.js` | Error-swallow detector — walks `.js`/`.jsx`/`.mjs`/`.cjs`/`.ts`/`.tsx`/`.mts`/`.cts`. Flags empty `catch {}` blocks (error / warning in tests), catch blocks that only `console.log`/`logger.error` without re-throwing or calling `next(err)` (error), `.catch(() => {})` / `.catch(() => null)` / `.catch(noop)` (error), `process.on('uncaughtException' | 'unhandledRejection')` handlers that neither re-throw nor `process.exit` (warning), Node-callback `(err, ...) => {}` whose body never references `err` (warning), fire-and-forget statement-level calls to promise-returning methods (`.save()`, `.commit()`, `.send()`, `.fetch()`, etc.) with no `await` / `.then(...)` / `.catch(...)` (warning, skipped in test files) | Adding new promise-returning method names or swallow patterns |
| `src/modules/n-plus-one.js` | N+1 query detector — ORM-agnostic, line-heuristic. Builds a loop-range map (string-aware brace + paren matching) for block-form `for`/`while`/`do` and callback-form `.map`/`.forEach`/`.filter`/`.reduce`/`.some`/`.every`/`.flatMap`. Inside each loop body, looks for `await` (or `.then(`) + a query-shaped call across Prisma (`prisma.<model>.find*/create/update/delete/upsert/count/aggregate/groupBy`, `$queryRaw`), Sequelize (`Model.findOne/findAll/findByPk/...`, `sequelize.query`), TypeORM (`.manager.save/find/...`, `getRepository`, `repo.findOne/findOneBy/...`), Mongoose (`Model.findOne/find/create/updateOne/...`), Knex (`knex(...)`, `db('t').where/select/first`), node-pg/MySQL (`client.query`, `pool.execute`, `db.query`), Drizzle (`db.select().from(...)`). Recognises `await Promise.all(arr.map(async () => ...))` as batched-ok and emits info instead of error | Adding new ORM shapes or loop openers |
| `src/modules/retry-hygiene.js` | Retry-hygiene scanner — finds retry-shaped loops (`while (...)` / `for (...)` bodies that contain an HTTP call or a literal sleep) across `fetch`/`axios`/`got`/`node-http`/`needle`/`superagent`. Flags `while (true)` / `for (;;)` without a `break` or max-attempts marker (error: unbounded-loop), literal `setTimeout`/`sleep`/`delay`/`new Promise(..setTimeout)` with no `attempt`-based multiplier (warning: no-backoff), literal sleeps with no `Math.random()`/`crypto.randomInt()` jitter (warning: no-jitter), retry blocks referencing 4xx status without a `throw`/`return`/`break` bail-out guard (warning: retry-on-4xx). Recognises `async-retry`/`p-retry`/`retry`/`cockatiel`/`opossum` as library-backed retry and emits info-level `library-ok` | Adding new HTTP clients, retry libraries, or sleep primitives |
| `src/modules/race-condition.js` | Race-condition / check-then-act detector — walks JS/TS sources looking for TOCTOU patterns: `fs.exists*`/`fs.stat`/`fs.access` followed within 15 lines by a destructive fs op (`unlink`/`rm`/`rename`/`chmod`/`chown`/`copyFile`/`truncate`) on the same path expression (error, warning inside test files); `fs.stat` followed by ANY mutating fs op (broader: symlink-race vector). Prisma/Sequelize/Mongoose/TypeORM `findFirst`/`findUnique`/`findOne` followed by `create`/`update`/`upsert`/`save`/`delete` on the same model with no visible `$transaction` / `FOR UPDATE` / `ON CONFLICT` / upsert / `P2002`/`23505`/`ER_DUP_ENTRY` handler (warning: get-or-create lost-update). Argument-matching on the first param of the mutate call avoids cross-function false-positives; idempotent `if (!exists) mkdirSync(.., { recursive: true })` setup is not flagged | Adding new TOCTOU shapes, ORM model surfaces, or tx markers |
| `src/modules/resource-leak.js` | Resource-leak detector — walks JS/TS and flags unclosed `fs.createReadStream`/`createWriteStream` (error), `fs.open`/`fs.promises.open` file handles (warning), `new WebSocket`/`EventSource`/`ReconnectingWebSocket`, `net.createConnection`/`createServer` (warning). setInterval: bare calls with discarded return value (error) and captured handles that are never `clearInterval(...)`-ed (warning). Recognises `stream.pipeline(x, ...)` / `stream.finished(x, ...)` as cleanup, plus escape paths through `return`/`module.exports`/`export`/property-assignment (`this.timers = ...`) and array push/set/add — so legitimate handle-storage patterns don't false-positive. Block-comment / JSDoc aware | Adding new resource-acquiring APIs or escape-path shapes |
| `src/modules/ssrf.js` | SSRF / URL-validation gap detector — tracks taint from `req.body`/`req.query`/`req.params`/`req.headers`/`ctx.request`/`event.body` to HTTP client calls (`fetch`/`axios`/`got`/`http.request`/`https.request`/`needle`/`superagent`/`request`/`undici`/`ky`). Flags: inline tainted URLs (error), tainted variables handed to the client without intermediate validation (error), hardcoded metadata-service endpoints (AWS 169.254.169.254, GCP metadata.google.internal, Azure metadata.azure.com, Alibaba 100.100.100.200) (error), suspicious-named variables (`webhookUrl`, `callbackUrl`, `redirectUrl`, `imageUrl`, `targetUrl`, etc.) with no visible validation (warning). Suppresses on `validateUrl`/`isValidUrl`/`allowedHosts.includes`/`new URL(x).hostname` guards. Records info-level `library-ok` for `ssrf-req-filter` / `request-filtering-agent` / `safe-url` / `ssrfcheck` imports | Adding new HTTP clients, taint sources, validators, or cloud metadata endpoints |
| `src/modules/hardcoded-url.js` | Hardcoded-URL / localhost / private-IP leak detector — walks JS/TS sources and flags string-embedded URLs pointing at `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`/`0.0.0.0` (error), RFC1918 ranges (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16) (error), link-local 169.254/16 (error), internal TLDs (`.internal`/`.local`/`.lan`/`.corp`) and staging subdomains (`staging.`/`dev.`/`qa.`/`uat.`) (warning), non-TLS `http://` external URLs (warning). Suppresses on: test/e2e/stories/fixture paths (downgrades to info), files matching `playwright.config.*` / `vitest.config.*` / etc., URLs used as filter patterns (`.startsWith`/`.includes`/`.match`/`===`/`new RegExp`), the env-fallback pattern (`process.env.X \|\| "http://..."`), dev-context variable names (`DEV_URL`/`LOCAL_URL`), `NODE_ENV !== 'production'` guards on the current or preceding 3 lines, and doc-example URLs (example.com, etc.). Block-comment / line-comment aware | Adding new URL shapes, dev-guard patterns, or doc allowlist entries |
| `src/modules/env-vars.js` | Env-vars contract scanner — cross-references declared env vars (`.env.example`/`.env.*.example`/`vercel.json`/`netlify.toml`/`docker-compose*.yml`/`.github/workflows/*.yml`) against actual reads in JS/TS (`process.env.X` / `process.env["X"]`), Python (`os.environ["X"]` / `os.environ.get("X")` / `os.getenv("X")`) and Go (`os.Getenv("X")` / `os.LookupEnv("X")`). Flags: referenced-but-not-declared (error: `missing-from-example`), declared-but-unreferenced (warning: `unused-in-code`), `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` / `VITE_*` / `REACT_APP_*` client-bundled keys (info: `client-exposed`). Runtime-allowlisted keys (`NODE_ENV`, `PORT`, `CI`, `VERCEL_*`, `GITHUB_*`, `AWS_*`, `PATH`, etc.) never flag. Test paths, dev-config files (`playwright.config.*`/`vitest.config.*`/`jest.config.*`/`cypress.config.*`), JSDoc block comments, line comments, and Python `"""` docstrings are skipped | Adding new declaration sources, new language grammars, or runtime-allowlist entries |
| `src/modules/async-iteration.js` | Async-iteration detector — flags `.reduce(async ...)` / `.reduceRight(async ...)` (error: silent-serialisation + Promise accumulator), `.filter(async ...)` / `.some(async ...)` / `.every(async ...)` / `.find*(async ...)` (error: Promise-truthy predicate), `.forEach(async ...)` (warning: enclosing function returns before inner awaits), and `.map(async ...)` / `.flatMap(async ...)` not wrapped in `Promise.all` / `Promise.allSettled` / `Promise.any` / `Promise.race` and not chained with `.then`/`.catch`/`.finally` (warning: unwrapped-map). String, line-comment, and block-comment contexts are skipped; test-path hits downgrade error → warning; `// async-iteration-ok` on the same or preceding line suppresses. Paren-depth walk backwards from the call site detects whether `.map` is inside a Promise combinator argument, avoiding false-positives on `Promise.all(arr.map(...))` | Adding new iterator methods, Promise combinators, or suppression markers |
| `src/modules/openapi-drift.js` | OpenAPI ↔ code drift detector — walks `openapi.{yaml,yml,json}` / `swagger.*` / `api-spec/*` and builds a (method, path) set. Walks JS/TS source and harvests routes from Express/Connect (`app.get`/`router.post`/etc.), Fastify (`fastify.get` + `fastify.route({ method, url })` object form), Koa + koa-router, Hono, and Next.js App Router (`app/api/**/route.{ts,js}` with exported `GET`/`POST`/`PATCH`/`PUT`/`DELETE`/`OPTIONS`/`HEAD` functions). Normalises Express-style `:id` to OpenAPI-style `{id}` and fuzzy-matches `{id}` ~= `{userId}` so param-name differences don't false-positive. Flags: code route missing from spec (error: `undocumented-route`), spec path with no matching handler (warning: `spec-ghost-route`). Test paths are excluded from code-harvest. Module is a no-op when no spec file is present | Adding new framework route shapes, new spec file conventions, or new method forms |
| `src/modules/cron-expression.js` | Cron-expression validator — harvests cron strings from `.github/workflows/*.yml` (GitHub Actions `schedule: [{ cron: "..." }]`), Kubernetes `CronJob` `spec.schedule`, `vercel.json` `crons[].schedule`, and source-code call sites: node-cron `cron.schedule('...')`, croner `new Cron('...')`, node-schedule `schedule.scheduleJob('...')`, APScheduler `CronTrigger.from_crontab('...')` (Python), Spring `@Scheduled(cron = "...")` (Java/Kotlin). Validates: field count (5 standard / 6 with seconds / predefined alias — error), per-field value ranges (minute 0-59, hour 0-23, DoM 1-31, month 1-12/JAN-DEC, DoW 0-7/SUN-SAT — error), step/range/list syntax, Quartz extensions (L/W/#), and impossible dates (Feb 30/31, Apr/Jun/Sep/Nov 31 — error, silent-killer). Warns on `* * * * *` every-minute cron and typo aliases (`@weely`). Test paths downgrade error → warning. `# cron-ok` / `// cron-ok` suppresses | Adding new cron harvest sources (Temporal schedules, Celery beat, AWS EventBridge cron), extended syntax (`?`/`L`/`W`/`#`), or alias lists |
| `src/modules/datetime-bug.js` | Datetime / timezone bug detector — walks JS/TS and Python sources for the five classic clock bugs: Python `datetime.now()` with no `tz=` argument (error: naive datetime — CI and prod use different timezones), Python `datetime.utcnow()` (error: deprecated in 3.12+, still returns naive), JS `new Date(yyyy, 1-12, dd)` (warning: months are 0-indexed — ambiguous between `Feb` bug and `Dec` correct-by-accident), JS `Date.UTC(yyyy, 1-12, dd)` (warning: same 0-vs-1 trap), `moment()` without a `.tz(...)` call on the same line (warning: silently uses local time, library in legacy mode since 2020). Block-comment, line-comment, Python `#` comments and triple-quoted docstrings are stripped before matching. Test paths downgrade error → warning (Python) and warning → info (JS). `// datetime-ok` / `# datetime-ok` on same or preceding line suppresses | Adding new clock-bug shapes (Luxon naive `DateTime.local()`, date-fns `startOfDay` without tz, Java `java.util.Date`, Go `time.Now()` without `Location`), or extending suppression markers |
| `src/modules/import-cycle.js` | Import-cycle / circular-dependency detector — walks JS/TS sources (`.js`/`.jsx`/`.mjs`/`.cjs`/`.ts`/`.tsx`/`.mts`/`.cts`), builds an import graph from top-level `import ... from './x'`, `export { ... } from './x'`, top-level `require('./x')` (indent-0 only — lazy in-function requires are correctly ignored), resolves relative specifiers through extension-retry and `./x/index.<ext>` fallback, then runs iterative Tarjan's SCC algorithm to find every strongly-connected component of size ≥ 2. Reports: cycle of 2+ files (error: runtime TDZ / undefined-import bug), self-loop (error: file imports itself), summary (info). Skips: type-only imports (`import type` / `export type` / `import { type X }` — erased at build time), bare-package specifiers (`react`, `lodash` — external, cannot form cycles with local files). Test paths downgrade error → warning. `// import-cycle-ok` on the import line suppresses that edge | Adding new import forms (dynamic `import(...)` with string literal, tagged templates), TypeScript path-alias resolution via `tsconfig.json` paths, or new suppression markers |
| `src/modules/tls-security.js` | TLS / cert-validation-bypass detector — walks JS/TS and Python sources for the pattern that ships MITM-vulnerable code to prod: a developer disables TLS validation once for staging self-signed certs, forgets to re-enable. Nine rule classes: (1) JS `rejectUnauthorized: false` in https.Agent / tls options (error: `js-reject-unauthorized`). (2) JS `process.env.NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = "0"` global nuclear disable in both dot-form and bracket-form `process.env["..."] = "0"` — regex requires `process.env.` prefix so prose references don't FP (error: `js-env-bypass`). (3) JS `strictSSL: false` in request / superagent / got family (error: `js-strict-ssl`). (4) JS `insecure: true` (error: `js-insecure-flag`). (5) Python `verify=False` / `verify_ssl=False` / `ssl=False` as a kwarg — regex requires `[,(]` prefix to ensure it's an argument, not a type annotation (error: `py-verify-false`). (6) Python `ssl._create_unverified_context()` (error: `py-unverified-context`). (7) Python `.check_hostname = False` (error: `py-check-hostname-false`). (8) Python `ssl.CERT_NONE` / `cert_reqs='CERT_NONE'` (error: `py-cert-none`). (9) Python `urllib3.disable_warnings(InsecureRequestWarning)` (warning: `py-disable-warnings`). Two-phase JS line scan: env-bypass rule runs on block-stripped line (preserves `"0"` literal); all other rules run on fully string-stripped line (handles multi-line backtick templates). Python-side strips block/line/hash/triple-quoted-docstring comments. Test paths downgrade error → warning and warning → info. `// tls-ok` / `# tls-ok` on same or preceding line suppresses | Adding new bypass shapes (Go `tls.Config{InsecureSkipVerify: true}`, Java `TrustAllCerts`, .NET `ServerCertificateValidationCallback`), hostname-spoofing detection, cert-pinning enforcement, or cert-expiry scanning |
| `src/modules/cookie-security.js` | Cookie / session-security config detector — walks JS/TS and Python sources for the misconfigurations that turn XSS into session takeover and let cookies ride over plain HTTP. Six rule classes: (1) JS `httpOnly: false` in cookie / session options (error: `js-httponly-false`) — cookie readable from `document.cookie`. (2) JS `secure: false` in cookie / session options (warning: `js-secure-false`) — cookie rides over plain HTTP. (3) JS `secret: '<known-weak>'` where the value is an obvious placeholder (`changeme`, `secret`, `default`, `password`, `keyboard cat`, `test`, `mysecret`, `sessionsecret`, `session-secret`, `abcd1234`, `foo`, `bar`, `change[_-]?me`, `your[_-]?secret[_-]?here`, `replace[_-]?me`, case-insensitive) (error: `js-weak-secret`). (4) Python `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = False` / `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = False` (warning: `py-cookie-secure-false`). (5) Python `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = False` / `CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = False` (error: `py-cookie-httponly-false`). (6) Python `httponly=False` kwarg on `response.set_cookie` / Starlette / FastAPI cookie helpers — regex requires `[,(]` prefix to ensure it's an argument (error: `py-fastapi-httponly-false`). Two-phase JS line scan: weak-secret rule runs on block-stripped line (preserves the string literal value for capture and reporting); other rules run on fully string-stripped line to avoid doc-string FPs. Python-side strips block/line/hash/triple-quoted-docstring comments. Test paths downgrade error → warning and warning → info. `// cookie-ok` / `# cookie-ok` on same or preceding line suppresses | Adding new cookie-setter libraries (cookie-session, iron-session specific shapes), Go `http.Cookie{Secure: false, HttpOnly: false}`, Java `Cookie.setHttpOnly(false)`, or stronger weak-secret heuristics (entropy-based detection) |
| `src/modules/feature-flag.js` | Feature-flag hygiene detector — walks JS/TS and Python sources for stale flags collapsed into compile-time constants. Three rule classes: (1) always-true conditional — `if (true)` / `if (1)` / `if (!false)` / `if (!0)` in JS/TS (error: `always-true-if`) and `if True:` / `if 1:` / `if not False:` in Python (error: `py-always-true-if`) — flag flipped permanently on, conditional forgotten. (2) always-false conditional — `if (false)` / `if (0)` / `if (!true)` / `if (!1)` (warning: `always-false-if`) and `if False:` / `if 0:` / `if not True:` (warning: `py-always-false-if`) — dead branch. (3) flag-named const bound to literal — JS `const FEATURE_X = true;` / `const ENABLE_Y = false;` in SCREAMING_SNAKE FEATURE_/ENABLE_/DISABLE_/FLAG_/USE_/SHOW_/HIDE_ prefix (warning: `stale-const`), Python module-level `FEATURE_X = True` (warning: `py-stale-const`). Deliberately restricts const-rule to `const` (not `let`/`var`) to avoid FP on `let hasErrored = false;` local mutable state. String-state tracker blanks out content of single/double/backtick strings so `if (false)` inside docstrings and multi-line prompt template literals does not trigger. Block-comment and line-comment stripped before matching. Minified files (`.min.js`, `.bundle.js`, `.prod.js`) skipped entirely. Test paths downgrade error → warning and warning → info. `// flag-ok` / `# flag-ok` on same or preceding line suppresses | Adding flag-API-vendor-specific detection (LaunchDarkly / Unleash / Split.io / Flagsmith / Optimizely / ConfigCat call-site patterns), stale-flag-age tracking (git blame), or duplicate-flag-string detection across files |
| `src/modules/log-pii.js` | Logging-hygiene / PII-in-logs detector — walks JS/TS and Python sources for the compliance-violation bug that ships in every codebase: `console.log(password)`, `logger.info(req.body)`, `log.debug(JSON.stringify(user))`. Four rule classes: (1) logger call (`console.{log,debug,info,warn,error}`, `logger.*`, `log.*`, winston/pino/bunyan/morgan/fastify.log) with a BARE sensitive identifier argument — password, passwd, pwd, token, apiKey, secret, credential, authorization, accessToken, refreshToken, idToken, jwt, bearer, cookie, session, ssn, creditCard, cardNumber, cvv, cvc, pin, privateKey (error: `sensitive-arg`, error on JS, `py-print-sensitive` on Python). (2) logger call with a BARE object-dump identifier — req, request, body, payload, user, member, account, profile, customer, headers, cookies, authHeader, session, formData (warning: `object-dump` on JS, `py-object-dump` on Python). (3) logger call with `JSON.stringify(x)` where `x` is sensitive or object-dump (warning: `stringify-dump`). (4) template-string interpolation `\`...${x}...\`` where `x` is a BARE sensitive/object identifier — the closing `}` must be directly after the identifier, so `${auth.type}` (safe label access) is correctly NOT flagged (error: `sensitive-interp` / warning: `object-interp`). Block-comment / line-comment / Python `#` and triple-quoted docstrings stripped before matching. Test paths downgrade error → warning and warning → info. `// log-safe` / `# log-safe` on same or preceding line suppresses | Adding new logger libraries, new sensitive-identifier names (pgp, ssh-key, mfa, otp), tuning the object-dump identifier list, or extending suppression markers |
| `src/modules/money-float.js` | Money / currency float-safety detector — walks JS/TS and Python sources for the "store-money-in-float" anti-pattern that causes `$0.01 * 1_000_000 = $9999.99...` accumulation drift and regulator-attention-grade rounding fraud. Flags: JS money-named variable (`price`, `total`, `amount`, `tax`, `fee`, `subtotal`, `balance`, `discount`, `usd`/`eur`/`gbp`/`jpy`/`cad`/`aud`/`nzd`/etc.) assigned from `parseFloat(...)` / `Number(...)` (error: `js-parse-float`), class/object property form `this.amount = parseFloat(...)` (error: `js-parse-float-prop`), Python money-named variable assigned from `float(...)` (error: `py-float-cast`), and JS `.toFixed(0)` / `.toFixed(1)` on any money-named receiver (warning: `insufficient-precision` — sub-cent rounding bug). Safe-harbour: if the file imports a known decimal library (decimal.js / big.js / bignumber.js / dinero.js / currency.js / money-math / cashify / `new Decimal()` / `new Big()` / `new BigNumber()` / `Dinero()`) or the Python `decimal` stdlib (`from decimal import Decimal`, `import decimal`), the float-cast rules don't fire. Block-comment, line-comment, Python `#` and triple-quoted docstrings stripped before matching. Test paths downgrade error → warning. `// money-float-ok` / `# money-float-ok` on same or preceding line suppresses | Adding new currency codes, money-named identifiers, decimal-safe libraries, or language backends (Go `float64` on money, Java `double`) |
| `src/modules/redos.js` | ReDoS / catastrophic-regex detector — walks JS/TS/Python sources and extracts regex patterns from literal form (`/pattern/flags`), constructor form (`new RegExp("...")` / `RegExp("...")`), and Python `re.compile` / `re.match` / `re.search` (both `r"..."` raw and `"..."` regular). Constructor-form patterns are unescaped one level so `"\\d+"` is analysed as `\d+`. Tests for three shape-based rules: nested quantifier where the inner element can match empty or has its own quantifier (error: catastrophic backtracking, `(a+)+`, `(.*)*`, `(?:[abc]+)*`), alternation with overlapping branches inside a quantified group (error: `(a|a)*`, `(\d|\d+)*`), and greedy `.*`/`.+` with unanchored polynomial backtracking (warning). Plus one data-flow rule: `new RegExp(req.*.*)` / `RegExp(userInput)` etc. — user-controlled regex construction (error, CWE-1333 injection). Line / block / Python hash comments are stripped before extraction. Test paths downgrade error → warning. `// redos-ok` on same or preceding line suppresses | Adding new regex-source forms (tagged templates, .sregex), new catastrophic shapes, new taint sources |
| `src/modules/pr-size.js` | PR-size enforcer — resolves a git diff against a base ref (config.against, or auto-detect via staged / working-tree / HEAD~1), parses `git diff --numstat` output (with fallback to unified-diff bodies, including numstat rename shapes `old => new` and `src/{a => b}/file`) and enforces four independent limits: total files (soft 50 / hard 100 — warning / error), total lines added+removed (soft 500 / hard 1000), per-file lines (soft 300 / hard 500), and top-level directory sprawl (warning at >3, catches mixed-concern PRs). Auto-excludes lockfiles (package-lock, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock, Gemfile.lock, Cargo.lock, poetry.lock, composer.lock, go.sum, mix.lock, flake.lock), build output (`dist/`, `build/`, `out/`, `.next/`, `coverage/`, `node_modules/`, `vendor/`, `target/`, `bin/`), minified/bundled files (`*.min.*`, `*.bundle.*`), snapshot tests (`*.snap`), and source-maps (`*.map`). Summary line always fires (info). No-op outside a git repo or when no diff is available | Adding new exclusion patterns, new thresholds, or a new diff-parse form |
| `src/modules/homoglyph.js` | Homoglyph / Unicode-lookalike detector — flags bidirectional-override / isolate characters (U+202A..U+202E, U+2066..U+2069) as Trojan Source attack shape (error, CVE-2021-42574), Cyrillic / Greek letters embedded inside otherwise-Latin identifiers (error: supply-chain / code-review bypass vector; covers `а` U+0430, `е` U+0435, `о` U+043E, `р` U+0440, `с` U+0441, `х` U+0445, `у` U+0443, `ѕ` U+0455, Greek `ο` U+03BF, `ρ` U+03C1, etc.), zero-width chars U+200B/U+200C/U+200D/U+2060/U+FEFF mid-file (warning: identifier-shadow vector), and other non-printable control chars (warning). Identifier scan uses a string-and-comment stripper so translation-string contents don't false-positive. Locale paths (`locales/`, `i18n/`, `lang/`, `translations/`, `intl/`, `l10n/`), locale extensions (`.po`/`.pot`/`.xliff`/`.arb`/`.mo`), and doc extensions (`.md`/`.mdx`/`.rst`) are exempt. BOM on the first byte of the first line is allowed | Adding new lookalike letters, locale-path patterns, or control-char allowlist |
| `src/core/host-bridge.js` | Abstract `HostBridge` base, bridge registry (`createBridge`/`registerBridge`), canonical commit-status vocabulary, shared PR/MR markdown formatter | Before adding a new host integration or touching cross-host logic |
| `src/core/github-bridge.js` | Concrete `GitHubBridge` extending `HostBridge` — GitHub-specific REST calls, circuit breaker, retry, JWT auth | Anything GitHub-specific; prefer `HostBridge` for cross-host work |
| `bin/gatetest.js` | CLI flags, help text, watch mode | Adding CLI features |
| `website/app/api/scan/run/route.ts` | The actual scan execution | Changing scan logic |

## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (Vercel)

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Stripe API (sk_live_... or sk_test_...) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Stripe client key |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | https://gatetest.ai |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Stripe webhook signing |
| `GLUECRON_BASE_URL` | Gluecron deployment URL (default https://gluecron.com) |
| `GLUECRON_API_TOKEN` | Gluecron PAT (scope: `repo`, format `glc_<64hex>`) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude API for AI review |
| `GATETEST_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Admin console password for `/admin` (bypasses Stripe) |
| `INTEGRATIONS_SECRET` | Phase 5.3 — encrypts customer-supplied access tokens at rest (≥32 chars; rotate to invalidate stored tokens) |
| `SENTRY_CLIENT_ID` / `SENTRY_CLIENT_SECRET` | Phase 5.3.1 — customer-Sentry OAuth integration. Until set, `/api/integrations/sentry/connect` returns 503 with hint |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` | gatetest.ai's OWN Sentry — browser-side error capture. From Sentry project settings → Client Keys (DSN). Public-safe by design |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | gatetest.ai's OWN Sentry — server-side. Same DSN as above (Sentry treats client/server keys identically) |
| `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` | Sourcemap upload at build time. From sentry.io/settings/auth-tokens with `project:releases` + `org:read` scopes. Only needed in CI/Vercel; locally the build skips upload |
| `SENTRY_ORG` / `SENTRY_PROJECT` | Sentry org slug + project slug — required for sourcemap upload to find the right destination |
| `SENTRY_RELEASE` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_RELEASE` | Optional commit SHA so errors are pinned to the right release |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Vercel-cron auth for `/api/admin/learning/cron` (Phase 5.2.2 weekly FP-scorer refresh) |

## KNOWN ISSUES — QUEUED FOR FIX

| # | Issue | Severity | Status |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Scan page needs fresh checkout — stale sessions show "cancelled" | MEDIUM | DONE (2026-04-16) — `/api/scan/status` now returns a new `status: "expired"` state when `piStatus === "canceled"` AND no `scan_status` metadata exists (i.e. session expired BEFORE scan ran). Page renders a dedicated slate-palette "Session Expired" block with a prominent "Start New Scan" CTA, distinct from the amber failure state. |
| 2 | Website design needs major upgrade — current is basic | HIGH | IN PROGRESS (2026-04-17) — Shipped this session under Craig's "just do it all" authorization: animated hero grid background with radial mask + 40s drift, gradient-shimmer on `.gradient-text`, gradient section dividers, enhanced card hover (teal glow + lift + inner highlight), enhanced `btn-primary` with active-state press + larger shadow, terminal scanline animation, footer teal accent bar. Modules.tsx fully restructured from 13-active/8-soon to all 67 modules across 9 categories (Source & quality / Security / Reliability / Web & UX / Infrastructure / Developer hygiene / AI & advanced / Scanning & testing / Language coverage). Remaining wishlist (for post-launch): navbar dual-layer glass, stats counter-animation on scroll, comparison-bar fill-on-scroll, module-card 3D perspective. |
| 3 | Stripe test keys not yet swapped in | MEDIUM | Craig action |
| 4 | GitHub App not yet installed on test repo | MEDIUM | Craig action |
| 5 | Crontech.ai protection — workflow shipped in `integrations/`, needs `install.sh` run from that repo | HIGH | Craig action (or expand MCP scope) |
| 6 | Gluecron.com protection — workflow shipped in `integrations/`, needs `install.sh` run from that repo | HIGH | Craig action (or expand MCP scope) |
| 7 | MCP GitHub scope currently restricted to `ccantynz-alt/gatetest` — blocks pushing protection into Crontech/Gluecron directly. Expand to owner-wide scope. | HIGH | Craig action — see `.claude/` config |
| 8 | Gluecron-first direction ratified in the Bible — still need Gluecron's API surface (endpoints, auth, webhook model) before the `HostBridge` refactor can ship a `GluecronBridge`. | HIGH | DONE (2026-04-19) — GluecronBridge shipped, website callers swapped off GitHub App. `src/core/gluecron-bridge.js` implements the HostBridge contract; `website/app/lib/gluecron-client.ts` replaces `github-app.ts` in scan/run, scan/fix, scan-executor, and admin/health. Env migrated to `GLUECRON_BASE_URL` + `GLUECRON_API_TOKEN`. `src/core/github-bridge.js` kept as a sibling implementation per the HostBridge architecture. **REVERSED 2026-04-22 on the `/api/webhook` sub-clause** — see Known Issue #27 (dual-host revival). The Gluecron migration as a whole stands; only the GitHub webhook shutdown was premature. |
| 9 | `HostBridge` abstraction not yet extracted from `src/core/github-bridge.js`. Pre-authorized. Safe to do in parallel with getting Gluecron answers. | MEDIUM | DONE (2026-04-14) — `src/core/host-bridge.js` shipped, `GitHubBridge extends HostBridge`, registry + shared markdown formatter + 21 contract tests green. Gluecron bridge can plug in without further refactor once API surface is known. |
| 10 | Our own `.github/workflows/ci.yml:49` has `continue-on-error: true` on the GateTest job — Bible Forbidden #24 violation. Caught by the new `ciSecurity` module (dog-fooded). Fix = remove that line once the self-scan is known-green; until then the gate is advisory-only in our own CI. | HIGH | DONE (2026-04-16) — `continue-on-error: true` removed from BOTH the gatetest-quick step (ci.yml:51) and the gatetest-full step (ci.yml:90). SARIF / artifact upload steps keep `continue-on-error` because Forbidden #24 scopes to the gate step itself. Self-scan is green: 816/816 tests pass, 67/67 modules load, website builds clean. |
| 11 | Landing-page hero (`website/app/components/Hero.tsx:16,28,71`) says "13 Modules". Product ships 67 modules per Bible v1.40.0 version string. Marketing drift — day-one customers will see numbers that don't match docs / CLI `--list`. | HIGH | DONE (2026-04-17) — Craig authorized "just do it all". All 13→67 references aligned across 9 surfaces: `Hero.tsx` (4 places incl. badge, subhead, terminal output, stat tile), `Pricing.tsx` (Full Scan description + features), `layout.tsx` (structured-data Offer), `manifest.json`, `opengraph-image.tsx`, `api/checkout/route.ts` (2 places), `scan/status/page.tsx` (2 CTAs), `admin/AdminPanel.tsx`. Hero stat "200+ Quality Checks" also bumped to "800+" to match product reality. |
| 12 | 31 of 67 modules have no 1:1 `tests/<name>.test.js` file (ai-review, agentic, accessibility, chaos, code-quality, compatibility, csharp, data-integrity, documentation, e2e, explorer, go-lang, integration-tests, java, kotlin, links, lint, live-crawler, mutation, performance, php, python, ruby, rust-lang, secrets, seo, swift, syntax, unit-tests, visual). 816 tests pass so they're not untested — most are covered via integration paths, shared universal-checker tests, or reporter tests — but per-module test files are still missing. Quality Bar #1 risk: a silent regression in one of these modules may not fail a specific test. | MEDIUM | DONE (2026-04-17) — 31 baseline test files shipped in one batch. 19 modules exercised end-to-end via `mod.run(result, { projectRoot: tmp })` against a scratch tmpdir (syntax, lint, secrets, unitTests, integrationTests, accessibility, compatibility, dataIntegrity, documentation, python, go-lang, rust-lang, java, ruby, php, csharp, kotlin, swift). 12 modules narrowed to shape-only (name / description / `typeof run === 'function'`) — 9 for external-surface reasons (e2e, visual, performance, chaos, mutation, aiReview, agentic, liveCrawler, explorer) and 3 because they require the full `GateTestConfig` object not a plain `{}` (codeQuality, links, seo). Suite count jumped from 263 to 298; pass count jumped from 816/816 to 864/864. All green. |
| 13 | **Webhook signature verification fails open** — both `/api/webhook/route.ts:108` (GitHub) and `/api/stripe-webhook/route.ts:32` (Stripe) returned `true` when the respective secret env var was unset. Any attacker could forge events → trigger scans on any installed repo, forge payment-capture events. | CRITICAL | DONE (2026-04-18) — Both endpoints now **fail closed**: missing secret ⇒ reject. Added explicit empty-signature / empty-signature-array guards to Stripe path. Bible Forbidden #15 compliance. |
| 14 | **Marketing copy drift** — "20 modules" resurfaced across 8 surfaces (layout.tsx metadata x3 + structured-data, Cta.tsx x3, github/setup x2, github/installed x1). Customers would see "20" in the hero/meta and "67" in checkout. | HIGH | DONE (2026-04-18) — All 8 replaced with "67 modules" (+ structured-data description). |
| 15 | **Phantom "$199 Scan + Fix" tier in Cta.tsx:29** — tier did not exist in `/api/checkout` TIERS (only `quick` $29 and `full` $99). Customer click-through would mismatch checkout. | HIGH | DONE (2026-04-18) — Cta card now shows "Full Scan — $99 / All 67 modules". |
| 16 | **Commit status hangs forever on scan crash** — `/api/webhook/route.ts` processWebhook set `pending`, fire-and-forget scan, if scan threw the commit stayed at "Scanning..." indefinitely. | HIGH | DONE (2026-04-18) — Wrapped the whole pipeline in try/catch that forces status→`failure` with "Scan failed — please retry" description on any thrown error. Tracks `pendingSha` so the failure goes on the right commit. |
| 17 | **PII in error logs** — `/api/stripe-webhook/route.ts:161` logged full `sessionId`, `paymentIntentId`, `tier`, `repoUrl` on missing-metadata events. Logging infrastructure becomes a PII store. | HIGH | DONE (2026-04-18) — Logs now emit only 12-char prefixes of Stripe IDs + boolean `tierPresent` / `repoUrlPresent` flags. Enough to correlate, not enough to reconstruct. |
| 18 | **Checkout error leaks Stripe internals** — `/api/checkout/route.ts:161` returned raw `err.message` to the browser. Stack traces and Stripe API error shapes exposed. | HIGH | DONE (2026-04-18) — Server-side log preserves full error; user-facing response is a generic "Checkout failed. Please try again or contact support." |
| 19 | **Admin brute-force resistance weak** — `/api/admin/auth/route.ts` had a fixed 400ms delay on failure. At ~150 guesses/minute a long-lived attacker could enumerate passwords. | HIGH | DONE (2026-04-18) — Bumped to randomised 1500-2500ms delay (jitter eliminates timing side-channels, ceiling ~30 guesses/minute vs. an exponential-entropy password). Durable per-IP lockout requires external state; tracked as follow-up. |
| 20 | **`/api/scan/run` had no idempotency** — browser refresh / back-button / network retry / concurrent stripe-webhook after() would re-run the scan AND re-capture the PI. Potential double-charge or overwrite of a valid result. | HIGH | DONE (2026-04-18) — Added Stripe-metadata-based idempotency: before scanning, fetch the PI, check `metadata.scan_status`. If `complete` or `failed`, return the cached state; do not re-scan, do not re-capture. Lookup failures fall through to scan (never block a legit customer on a stale lookup). |
| 21 | **scan/status page could stick at "Scanning..."** — `/scan/status/page.tsx` only recognised `complete`/`failed`/`expired`. Any other status from `/api/scan/run` (pending/running/cancelled/malformed) left the header reading "Scanning..." with a full progress bar. | MEDIUM | DONE (2026-04-18) — Unknown statuses are normalised to `failed` with an `error: "Scan returned unexpected state: X"` so the user always reaches a resolved UI and sees retry CTA. |
| 22 | **GitHub App `installation_id` not persisted** (`/api/github/callback/route.ts:17`). Without this, webhooks carry an `installation_id` but we can't map it to a billing customer → multi-org customers lose correlation. Flagged by scan/payment + GitHub-App audits 2026-04-18. | HIGH | Craig action — requires schema extension (new `installations` table or equivalent in Neon) and touches user data. Bible Boss Rule #9 triggers. |
| 23 | **PR comments are not idempotent** — `/api/webhook/route.ts:438` posts a fresh comment per push. On a busy PR the thread fills with dupes. | MEDIUM | Post-launch polish — find-and-edit prior bot comment, or collapse into a single updating comment. |
| 24 | **GitHub file-tree fetch is unbounded** on `?recursive=1` — monorepos with 100k+ files will exhaust Vercel's per-function budget. | MEDIUM | Post-launch — add pagination / file-count ceiling / graceful degradation message when a repo is too large. |
| 25 | **Rate-limit wait cap** in `github-bridge.js:138` only waits if backoff < 120s. GitHub resets can be 60 minutes out, meaning we skip the wait and hammer 429. | MEDIUM | Post-launch — queue and respect longer resets, or refuse scans during the cool-down window. |
| 26 | **No `vercel.json` maxDuration** for `/api/scan/run` — full scan targets <60s but no hard cap is pinned at the platform layer. If a scan hangs it'll be killed mid-way at Vercel's plan-default. | MEDIUM | Craig action — pin `maxDuration: 300` once deployment plan is confirmed (Boss Rule #5 / deployment config). |
| 27 | **Dual-host revival (Phase 1 shipped)** — `/api/webhook` no longer 410s; it accepts GitHub App push / pull_request events, HMAC-verifies `X-Hub-Signature-256` against `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (fail-closed, Forbidden #15), and enqueues into the shared `scan_queue` via `scan-queue-store.enqueueScan` — same path as Gluecron's Signal Bus. Uses `X-GitHub-Delivery` as the idempotency `eventId`. `gluecron-client.ts` already has GitHub PAT fallback so scans actually run. Helpers in `website/app/lib/github-events.js`, 23 unit tests in `tests/github-events.test.js`. Strategic direction updated from "Gluecron-first" to "dual-host, Gluecron-long-term". | HIGH | DONE (2026-04-22) — Phase 1 shipped. Phase 2 queued as Issue #28. |
| 28 | **Dual-host Phase 2: GitHub commit-status + PR comment callback** — worker currently calls Gluecron's callback only. GitHub-host scans run and are stored, but the customer's PR page shows no feedback. Needs `scan-worker.js` to branch on event origin (detect via repository↔installation lookup or add a `host` column to `scan_queue`) and call `GitHubBridge.postCommitStatus` + `GitHubBridge.postPullRequestComment` for GitHub-hosted jobs. Without this, GitHub Marketplace listing has no visible product loop. | HIGH | DONE (2026-04-23) — `scan_queue.host` column added (ALTER TABLE IF NOT EXISTS for safe migration). `github-events.js` tags jobs `host='github'`; `events-push.js` tags `host='gluecron'`. `website/app/lib/github-callback.js` posts commit status (success/failure/error) + formatted PR comment with per-module breakdown via global `fetch` using `GATETEST_GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN`. Worker tick `dispatchCallback()` branches on `job.host`. 28 new tests in `tests/github-callback.test.js`. 1048/1048 tests pass, website builds clean. |
| 29 | **GitHub Marketplace listing itself** — distribution channel. Requires Craig's action: create Marketplace listing in GitHub App settings, upload logo/screenshots, choose free-tier-with-upsell model, approval workflow (~2-3 weeks). Out of scope for code agents; listing copy can be drafted in the repo for Craig's review. | HIGH | Craig action (Boss Rule #8 — public-facing comms). |
| 30 | **MCP server unreliable on Windows** — surfaced by the prepublish gate during Craig's first manual `npm publish` from a Windows laptop. The MCP server starts but never responds to JSON-RPC over stdin; all 14 mcp-server tests timeout. Suspected cause: Node.js stdin pipe race on Windows where the SDK's `data` listener attaches via top-level `await server.connect(transport)` after the spawning parent has already written the message + closed the pipe — Linux pipe buffering tolerates this, Windows doesn't. Tests now skip on `process.platform === 'win32'` so Windows local publish doesn't block on this; the production MCP server has the same bug on Windows but is documented as a known limitation. Fix targeted for v1.0.2: investigate switching the SDK transport to a `'readable'`-listener pattern, or upstream a fix to `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. | MEDIUM | Open — investigate v1.0.2. |
| 31 | **Cross-platform path-separator bugs in scanner detection (FIXED 2026-05-03)** — surfaced by the prepublish gate on Windows. Three scanner modules (`homoglyph`, `env-vars`, `universal-checker`) used regexes hardcoded with forward-slash path separators against `path.relative()` output, which emits backslashes on Windows. Caused mis-detection of test files (no severity downgrade), locale paths (false-positive Unicode flags), and `.github/workflows/` env-var declarations. Fixed by normalising `rel = ...split(path.sep).join('/')` at every comparison point. Plus 4 false-positive-fixes regression tests asserted forward-slash strings against `path.relative()` output — fixed with a `rel(root, p)` test helper that normalises. Plus `tests/runtime.test.js` `_stateFile` test hardcoded `/tmp/test` — fixed to use `os.tmpdir()`. | HIGH | DONE (2026-05-03) — see commits on branch `claude/catchup-w0BVr`. |

## THE AGGRESSIVE MANDATE (REPRISE)

**This is not a hobby project. This is a business. Craig needs revenue.**

Every feature must be the BEST implementation available. Every check must be DEEPER than the competition. Every report must be more ACTIONABLE. Every module must catch REAL bugs.

The website must look like it was built in 2026 by the most advanced AI on the planet — because it was. Not the 80s. Not "functional but ugly." STUNNING.

The scan experience must be CINEMATIC. Customers watch their repo get scanned in real time with animations, progress, and drama. They WANT to watch it.

If a competitor does something we don't, that's a GateTest bug. Fix it.

**No scatter-gun. No drift. No chicken scratchings. No "just this once."**

**GateTest dominates or GateTest dies. There is no second place.**

---

## VERSION

GateTest v1.41.0 — 90 modules (24 core + 9 universal language checkers
for Python, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby, PHP, C#, Kotlin, Swift + 7 **infra
& supply-chain hardening scanners** — dependencies (npm/pip/Pipenv/
Poetry/go.mod/Cargo/Bundler/Composer/Maven/Gradle), Dockerfile,
CI-security (GitHub Actions + GitLab CI), shell scripts,
SQL migrations, Terraform/IaC, Kubernetes manifests + 1 **AI-app
security scanner** — prompt/LLM safety (client-bundled API keys,
unbounded max_tokens cost-DoS, prompt-injection surfaces, deprecated
models) + 1 **codebase hygiene scanner** — dead code / unused
exports / orphaned files across JS/TS/Python, rotting commented-out
blocks + 1 **credential-lifecycle scanner** — git-aware secret
rotation (stale > 90d / aging > 30d), `.env`↔`.env.example` drift,
placeholder-shaped-like-real detection + 1 **web-header / CORS
scanner** — CSP `unsafe-eval`/`unsafe-inline`, wildcard origin +
credentials, missing HSTS/CSP/XFO/nosniff across Next.js, Vercel,
Netlify, nginx, Express/Fastify + 1 **TypeScript-strictness scanner**
— `tsconfig.json` regressions (`strict: false`, `noImplicitAny: false`,
`skipLibCheck: true`), `@ts-nocheck` / unreasoned `@ts-ignore` abuse,
`any`-leak detection across exported signatures and `as any` casts
+ 1 **flaky-test detector** — committed `.only` / `.skip` / `xit`,
unseeded `Math.random()`, real-clock `Date.now()` without fake timers,
real-HTTP `fetch`/`axios` calls without mock harness, `setTimeout`/
`setInterval` without fake timers, unrestored `process.env` mutations,
and self-admitted flaky titles ("sometimes", "intermittent", "flaky")
+ 1 **error-swallow detector** — empty `catch {}` blocks, log-and-eat
catches that don't re-throw, `.catch(() => {})` / `.catch(noop)` on
Promise chains, silent `process.on('uncaughtException')` handlers,
Node-callback `(err, ...) =>` that ignores `err`, and fire-and-forget
calls to `.save()`/`.commit()`/`.send()`/etc. without await or .catch)
+ 1 **N+1 query detector** — database queries inside loop bodies
across Prisma, Sequelize, TypeORM, Mongoose, Knex, Drizzle, node-pg,
MySQL2, and generic `db`/`orm`/`repo` shapes; understands block-form
(`for`/`while`/`for..of`/`for..in`) and callback-form (`.map`/
`.forEach`/`.filter`/`.reduce`) loops; recognises the
`await Promise.all(arr.map(async () => await db.query(...)))`
batched-parallel fix shape and records it as info rather than error
+ 1 **retry-hygiene scanner** — tight retry loops, no backoff,
unbounded retry across `fetch`/`axios`/`got`/`node-http`/`superagent`.
Flags `while (true)` / `for (;;)` with an HTTP call and no
`break`/max-attempts marker (error), constant literal sleeps with no
`attempt`-based multiplier (warning: no-backoff), constant sleeps
with no `Math.random()` jitter (warning: no-jitter), and retry
blocks that reference 4xx status without a `throw`/`return`/`break`
guard (warning: retry-on-4xx). Recognises `async-retry` / `p-retry` /
`retry` library use as info-level library-ok
+ 1 **race-condition detector** — TOCTOU / check-then-act patterns:
fs exists/stat → destructive op (unlink/rm/rename/chmod/copyFile/
truncate) on the same path (error, CWE-367, downgraded to warning
inside test files); `stat`/`lstat` → ANY mutating fs op on the same
path (symlink-race vector); Prisma/Sequelize/Mongoose/TypeORM
`findFirst`/`findUnique`/`findOne` → `create`/`update`/`upsert`/
`save`/`delete` on the same model with no visible `$transaction` /
`FOR UPDATE` / `ON CONFLICT` / upsert / duplicate-key-error handler
(warning: get-or-create lost-update). Skips the idempotent-setup
pattern `if (!exists) mkdirSync(..., { recursive: true })` and
single-arg-match on the mutate's first argument to avoid
cross-function false-positives
+ 1 **resource-leak detector** — unclosed `fs.createReadStream`/
`createWriteStream` (error), `fs.open`/`fs.promises.open` file
handles (warning), `new WebSocket`/`EventSource` and
`net.createConnection`/`createServer` (warning). setInterval: bare
calls with discarded return value (error) and captured handles that
are never `clearInterval`-ed (warning). Recognises
`stream.pipeline(x, ...)` and `stream.finished(x, ...)` as cleanup,
plus escape paths through `return`, `module.exports`/`export`,
property-assignment (`this.timers = ...`, `obj.handle = ...`) and
array push/set/add — so legitimate handle-storage patterns don't
false-positive. JSDoc / block-comment aware
+ 1 **SSRF / URL-validation gap detector** — taints `req.body`/
`req.query`/`req.params`/`req.headers`/`ctx.request`/`event.body`
sources and flags when tainted values reach `fetch`/`axios`/`got`/
`http.request`/`needle`/`superagent`/`undici`/`ky` without an
intermediate validator. Hardcoded cloud-metadata endpoints
(AWS 169.254.169.254, GCP metadata.google.internal, Azure
metadata.azure.com, Alibaba 100.100.100.200) are treated as error.
Suspicious-named vars (`webhookUrl`, `callbackUrl`, `redirectUrl`,
etc.) warn when handed to a client with no visible validation.
Suppresses on `validateUrl`/`isValidUrl`/`allowedHosts.includes`/
URL-hostname allowlist guards. Records info-level `library-ok` for
`ssrf-req-filter` / `request-filtering-agent` / `safe-url` /
`ssrfcheck` imports
+ 1 **hardcoded-URL / localhost / private-IP leak detector** —
flags strings in source that embed `http://localhost`, `127.0.0.1`,
`0.0.0.0` (error), RFC1918 ranges 10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16
(error), link-local 169.254/16 (error), internal TLDs
(`.internal`, `.local`, `.lan`, `.corp`) and staging subdomain
shapes (`staging.`, `dev.`, `qa.`, `uat.`) (warning), and plain
`http://` URLs pointing at external hosts (warning: downgrade /
mixed-content). Suppresses on filter-pattern use
(`.startsWith`/`.includes`/`.match`/`===`/`new RegExp`), the
env-fallback shape `process.env.X || "http://..."`, `NODE_ENV !==
'production'` guards, dev-context variable names (`DEV_URL`,
`LOCAL_URL`), test/e2e/stories/fixture paths (downgrade to info),
local-dev config files (`playwright.config.*`, `vitest.config.*`,
`jest.config.*`, `cypress.config.*`, `webpack.config.*`,
`vite.config.*`, `rollup.config.*`), and doc allowlist
(`example.com`, `your-domain.com`, etc.)
+ 1 **env-vars contract scanner** — cross-references declared
env vars (`.env.example` / `.env.*.example` / `vercel.json` /
`netlify.toml` / `docker-compose*.yml` / `.github/workflows/*.yml`
env blocks) against actual reads in JS/TS
(`process.env.X` / `process.env["X"]`), Python (`os.environ["X"]` /
`os.environ.get("X")` / `os.getenv("X")`) and Go (`os.Getenv("X")` /
`os.LookupEnv("X")`). Flags referenced-but-not-declared (error),
declared-but-unreferenced (warning), and `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` /
`VITE_*` / `REACT_APP_*` client-bundled keys (info). Runtime
allowlist (`NODE_ENV`, `PORT`, `CI`, `VERCEL_*`, `GITHUB_*`,
`AWS_*`, `PATH`, etc.) never flags. Skips test paths, dev-config
files (`playwright.config.*`, `vitest.config.*`, etc.), JSDoc
block comments, line comments, and Python `"""` docstrings
+ 1 **async-iteration detector** — catches the four canonical
Promise-meets-array-iterator footguns: `.reduce(async ...)` (error:
silently serialises, accumulator becomes a Promise chain the
developer didn't intend), `.filter/.some/.every/.find*(async ...)`
(error: Promise is truthy, predicate returns meaningless result),
`.forEach(async ...)` (warning: forEach doesn't await, enclosing
function returns before inner awaits resolve, errors are
swallowed), `.map(async ...)` not wrapped in
`Promise.all`/`allSettled`/`any`/`race` and not chained with
`.then`/`.catch`/`.finally` (warning: unwrapped-map, caller will
iterate Promises not values). Paren-depth walk backwards from the
call site detects whether `.map` is inside a Promise combinator
argument, avoiding false-positives on
`Promise.all(arr.map(async ...))`. Supports
`// async-iteration-ok` suppression on the same or preceding line
+ 1 **homoglyph / Unicode-lookalike detector** — catches the
Trojan Source (CVE-2021-42574) attack class plus the broader
homoglyph family. Flags bidirectional-override / isolate characters
(U+202A..U+202E, U+2066..U+2069) (error), Cyrillic / Greek letters
embedded inside otherwise-Latin identifiers (error: `а` U+0430,
`е` U+0435, `о` U+043E, `р` U+0440, `с` U+0441, `х` U+0445,
`у` U+0443, `ѕ` U+0455, Greek `ο` U+03BF, `ρ` U+03C1, ...),
zero-width chars U+200B / U+200C / U+200D / U+2060 / U+FEFF
mid-file (warning: identifier-shadow), and non-printable control
chars (warning). String, line-comment, and block-comment contents
are stripped before identifier scanning so translation strings
don't false-positive. Locale paths (`locales/`, `i18n/`, `lang/`,
`translations/`, `intl/`, `l10n/`), locale extensions (`.po`,
`.pot`, `.xliff`, `.arb`, `.mo`), and doc files (`.md`, `.mdx`,
`.rst`) are exempt. BOM on first byte of first line is allowed
+ 1 **OpenAPI ↔ code drift detector** — cross-references
`openapi.{yaml,yml,json}` / `swagger.*` against code routes across
Express / Connect / Fastify (block + object form) / Koa / Hono /
Next.js App Router (`app/api/**/route.ts` with exported `GET`/
`POST`/`PATCH`/`PUT`/`DELETE` functions). Normalises Express
`:id` → OpenAPI `{id}` and fuzzy-matches `{id}` ~= `{userId}` so
param-name differences don't false-positive. Flags: code route
missing from spec (error: `undocumented-route` — consumers of the
generated client won't know it exists), spec path with no matching
handler (warning: `spec-ghost-route`). No-op when no spec file is
present. Test paths excluded from code-harvest
+ 1 **PR-size enforcer** — blocks unreviewably-large pull requests
before they reach a human reviewer. Diffs HEAD against a base ref
(configurable, or auto-detected via staged/working-tree/HEAD~1),
counts added+removed lines, and enforces four independent limits:
total files (soft 50 / hard 100), total lines (soft 500 / hard 1000),
per-file lines (soft 300 / hard 500), and top-level directory sprawl
(warning at >3, catches mixed-concern PRs). Auto-excludes lockfiles
(package-lock, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock, Gemfile.lock, Cargo.lock,
poetry.lock, composer.lock, go.sum, mix.lock, flake.lock),
build output (`dist/`, `build/`, `out/`, `.next/`, `coverage/`,
`node_modules/`, `vendor/`, `target/`), minified/bundled files
(`*.min.*`, `*.bundle.*`), snapshot tests (`*.snap`), and
source-maps. Parses both `git diff --numstat` output (preferred)
and unified-diff bodies; handles numstat rename shapes
(`old => new` and `src/{a => b}/file`). Honest dogfood: fires
correctly against `main...HEAD` on a feature branch
+ 1 **ReDoS / catastrophic-regex detector** — catches the three
canonical regex-DoS shapes that hit every long-lived JS project
eventually: nested quantifier on an inner element that's itself
quantified or can match empty (`(a+)+`, `(.*)*`, `(?:[abc]+)*` —
error, catastrophic backtracking), alternation with overlapping
branches inside a quantified group (`(a|a)*`, `(\d|\d+)*` — error,
CWE-1333), and greedy `.*`/`.+` sequences in unanchored patterns
(warning). Plus one data-flow rule: `new RegExp(req.body.pattern)`
/ `RegExp(userInput)` — user-controlled regex construction (error,
injection vector). Extracts patterns from JS/TS regex literals
(`/pattern/flags`), `new RegExp("...")` constructors (unescapes
string-literal escapes so `"\\d+"` is analysed as `\d+`), and
Python `re.compile` / `re.match` / `re.search` (both raw and
regular string forms). Line-comment / block-comment aware. Test
paths downgrade error → warning. `// redos-ok` on the same or
preceding line suppresses
+ 1 **cron-expression validator** — catches the silent-killer bug
class: a typo in a cron string that either never fires (the worst
case, because nobody notices until prod blows up) or fires at
unintended times. Scans `.github/workflows/*.yml` GitHub Actions
`schedule: [{ cron: "..." }]`, Kubernetes `CronJob` `spec.schedule`,
`vercel.json` `crons[].schedule`, and source-code call sites:
node-cron `cron.schedule('...')`, croner `new Cron('...')`,
node-schedule `schedule.scheduleJob('...')`, APScheduler
`CronTrigger.from_crontab('...')` (Python), and Spring
`@Scheduled(cron = "...")` (Java/Kotlin). Validates: field count
(5 standard / 6 with seconds / predefined alias — error), out-of-
range values per field (minute 0-59, hour 0-23, DoM 1-31, month
1-12 or JAN-DEC, DoW 0-7 or SUN-SAT — error), step syntax
(`*/5`), ranges (`0-30`), lists (`1,5,10`), and Quartz extensions
(`L`, `W`, `#`). Catches impossible dates that will never fire
(Feb 30/31, Apr/Jun/Sep/Nov 31 — error, the actual silent-killer
case). Warns on too-frequent crons (`* * * * *` every minute)
and typo aliases (`@weely` instead of `@weekly`). Test paths
downgrade error → warning. `# cron-ok` / `// cron-ok` on same or
preceding line suppresses
+ 1 **datetime / timezone bug detector** — the "works on my machine,
breaks in prod" clock-bug class that every long-running codebase
eventually ships. Walks JS/TS and Python sources for five runtime-
silent failure modes: Python `datetime.now()` without a `tz=`
argument (error: returns naive datetime — CI runner and prod server
have different timezones, comparisons against aware datetimes
`TypeError` at runtime, comparisons against other naives silently
use local); Python `datetime.utcnow()` (error: deprecated in Python
3.12+, returns a naive datetime treated as local by anything that
checks `tzinfo is None` — use `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`);
JS `new Date(yyyy, 1-12, dd)` (warning: JS months are 0-indexed,
so month-literal 1..12 is nearly always wrong — either the bug
(`Feb 14` becomes `Mar 14`) or correct by accident that nobody can
tell); JS `Date.UTC(yyyy, 1-12, dd)` (warning: same 0-vs-1 trap);
`moment()` without a `.tz(...)` call on the same line (warning:
silently uses local time, Moment.js in legacy mode since 2020,
migrate to Luxon / date-fns / Day.js / Temporal). Block-comment,
line-comment, Python `#` comments and triple-quoted docstrings are
stripped before matching. Test paths downgrade error → warning
(Python) and warning → info (JS). `// datetime-ok` / `# datetime-ok`
on same or preceding line suppresses
+ 1 **import-cycle / circular-dependency detector** — the silent
runtime killer of large JS/TS codebases. Walks all `.js`/`.jsx`/
`.mjs`/`.cjs`/`.ts`/`.tsx`/`.mts`/`.cts` sources, builds an import
graph from top-level `import ... from './x'`, `export { ... } from
'./x'`, and indent-0 `require('./x')` (lazy in-function requires
are correctly ignored because they defer resolution to call time,
which is the standard cycle-break workaround). Resolves relative
specifiers through extension-retry and `./x/index.<ext>` fallback.
Runs iterative Tarjan's strongly-connected-component algorithm to
find every cycle of 2+ files (error: runtime TDZ / undefined-import
bug — the bug that reproduces randomly depending on test order,
hot-reload state, module-cache warmth, and is always a refactor to
fix). Also flags self-loops (file imports itself — always a bug).
Type-only imports (`import type`, `export type`, `import { type X }`)
are erased at build time and skipped. Bare-package specifiers
(`react`, `lodash`) are external and skipped. Test paths downgrade
error → warning. `// import-cycle-ok` on the import line suppresses
that specific edge
+ 1 **money / currency float-safety detector** — the textbook fintech
bug every company eventually ships: storing currency in IEEE-754
floating-point. `$0.10 + $0.20 !== $0.30` in JS, Python, Go, Java.
A $0.01 fee over a million transactions accrues hundreds of dollars
of drift. Regulators call this fraud. Walks JS/TS and Python sources,
flags money-named variables (`price`, `total`, `amount`, `tax`,
`fee`, `subtotal`, `balance`, `discount`, and currency codes
`usd`/`eur`/`gbp`/`jpy`/`cad`/`aud`/`nzd`/`chf`/etc.) assigned from
`parseFloat(...)` / `Number(...)` in JS (error), class-property
form `this.amount = parseFloat(...)` (error), Python `float(...)`
on money-named variable (error), and `.toFixed(0)` / `.toFixed(1)`
on money-named receiver — sub-cent precision rounding bug (warning).
Safe-harbour: if the file imports a known decimal library (decimal.js
/ big.js / bignumber.js / dinero.js / currency.js / money-math /
cashify, or Python's `decimal` stdlib), float-cast rules don't fire.
Test paths downgrade error → warning. `// money-float-ok` /
`# money-float-ok` on same or preceding line suppresses
+ 1 **logging-hygiene / PII-in-logs detector** — the GDPR / CCPA /
PCI-DSS violation that ships in every codebase at some point:
`console.log(req.body)`, `logger.info(user)`,
`log.debug(JSON.stringify(headers))`. Real postmortems include
Facebook 2019 (600M plaintext passwords), Twitter 2018 (330M),
GitHub 2018 (10M), Robinhood 2019 (multi-year). Walks JS/TS and
Python sources, flags four shapes: logger call with a bare sensitive
identifier (password, token, apiKey, secret, credential,
authorization, accessToken, jwt, cookie, session, ssn, creditCard,
cvv, pin, privateKey — error: `sensitive-arg` / `py-print-sensitive`),
logger call with a bare object-dump identifier (req, request, body,
payload, user, member, account, headers, cookies, session, formData
— warning: `object-dump`), logger call with `JSON.stringify(x)`
where `x` is sensitive or object-dump (warning: `stringify-dump`),
template-string interpolation `\`...${x}...\`` where `x` is a BARE
sensitive / object identifier (error: `sensitive-interp` / warning:
`object-interp`) — deliberately skips property-access shapes like
`${auth.type}` and `${event.name}` where the base identifier matches
but the access is safe. Supports JS (`console`, `logger`, `log`,
`winston`, `pino`, `bunyan`, `morgan`, `fastify.log`, `this.logger`)
and Python (`print`, `logger`, `log`, `logging`, `structlog`).
Block/line/hash comments and Python docstrings stripped before
matching. Test paths downgrade error → warning and warning → info.
`// log-safe` / `# log-safe` on same or preceding line suppresses,
+ 1 **feature-flag hygiene detector** — the quiet tax on every
codebase: stale flags that graduate to "permanent on" and stay in the
code as slower `if (true)`. LaunchDarkly's 2024 State of Feature
Management found orgs carry 5-10x more flags in code than they
actively toggle. Every stale flag is dead code waiting to go wrong:
a branch that stops getting tested, a default that quietly drifted,
a staff-only path accidentally reachable. Walks JS/TS and Python
sources, flags three shapes where the flag has collapsed into a
constant: always-true conditional (`if (true)` / `if (1)` /
`if (!false)` / `if (!0)` — error: `always-true-if` /
`py-always-true-if`), always-false conditional (`if (false)` /
`if (0)` / `if (!true)` / `if (!1)` — warning: `always-false-if` /
`py-always-false-if`), and flag-named const bound to a literal
(`const FEATURE_X = true;` / `const ENABLE_Y = false;` — warning:
`stale-const` / `py-stale-const`). Deliberately restricts const-rule
to `const` bindings in SCREAMING_SNAKE flag-prefixed form to avoid
false-positive on `let hasErrored = false;` local-state idioms.
Tracks string state across lines (including multi-line backtick
template literals) so `if (false)` embedded in docstrings and
prompt strings does not trigger. Test paths downgrade error →
warning and warning → info. `// flag-ok` / `# flag-ok` on same or
preceding line suppresses,
+ 1 **TLS / cert-validation-bypass detector** — the MITM-vulnerable
pattern that ships to prod every time a dev hits a self-signed cert
on staging and disables validation "just for now." Walks JS/TS and
Python sources, flags: `rejectUnauthorized: false` (error, Node
https.Agent / tls), `process.env.NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = "0"`
including bracket-form `process.env["..."] = "0"` (error, global
nuclear disable), `strictSSL: false` (error, request / superagent /
got), `insecure: true` (error), Python `verify=False` /
`verify_ssl=False` / `ssl=False` as a kwarg (error, requests / httpx
/ aiohttp / urllib3), Python `ssl._create_unverified_context()`
(error), `.check_hostname = False` (error), `ssl.CERT_NONE` /
`cert_reqs='CERT_NONE'` (error), and `urllib3.disable_warnings(
InsecureRequestWarning)` (warning, the tell-tale pairing with
verify=False). Two-phase line scan: env-bypass rule runs on the
block-stripped line (so `"0"` literal is preserved) and requires
`process.env.` prefix so prose / error-message text that references
the variable name does not FP. All other rules run on the fully
string-stripped line. Block / line / hash / triple-quoted docstring
comments stripped before matching. Test paths downgrade error →
warning and warning → info. `// tls-ok` / `# tls-ok` on same or
preceding line suppresses,
+ 1 **cookie / session-security config detector** — the
misconfiguration that turns XSS into session takeover and lets
cookies ride over plain HTTP. Walks JS/TS and Python sources, flags:
`httpOnly: false` in cookie / session options (error — cookie
readable from `document.cookie`), `secure: false` (warning — cookie
rides over plain HTTP), `secret: '<known-weak>'` with placeholder
values (`changeme` / `secret` / `default` / `password` /
`keyboard cat` / `mysecret` / `sessionsecret` / `abcd1234` / `foo`/
`bar` / `change[_-]?me` / `your[_-]?secret[_-]?here` /
`replace[_-]?me`, case-insensitive, error), Python
`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = False` / `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = False`
(warning), `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = False` /
`CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = False` (error), and `httponly=False` kwarg
on `response.set_cookie` / Starlette / FastAPI cookie helpers —
regex requires `[,(]` prefix so it only fires on actual argument
position (error). Two-phase JS line scan: weak-secret rule runs on
the block-stripped line (preserves the literal value for capture
and reporting); all other rules run on the fully string-stripped
line to avoid doc-string FPs. Block / line / hash / triple-quoted
docstring comments stripped before matching. Test paths downgrade
error → warning and warning → info. `// cookie-ok` / `# cookie-ok`

**Gluecron-ready `HostBridge` abstraction**: every git host
integration plugs into one contract (canonical commit-status states,
shared PR/MR markdown, registry-based bridge factory). `GitHubBridge`
is the first concrete implementation; `GluecronBridge` will be the
second.

Date last updated: 2026-04-29 — v1.43.0: **PHASE 5 — THE 110% MANDATE OPENED.** Brutal-honest scorecard against the theoretical "best AI diagnostic/fix tool ever made" put GateTest at ~22% of the ceiling (despite ~85% against today's shipping market). Craig: *"we need to be at 110%."* Phase 5 is the move from on-spec to category-defining: cross-repo intelligence (the brain), closed feedback loop (self-improving), live observability fusion (Sentry / Datadog / Vercel Analytics correlation), architectural surgery (multi-file refactor pipeline), cross-language unified semantics (one contract graph across JS / Python / Rust / etc.). Five sub-phases, each with definitions of done + real-repo proof requirements. Three new tiers planned ($599 Brain / $799 Production / $999 Refactor), each pre-authorised on Stripe wire-up only after the underlying capability ships with proof. Status: 0/5 sub-phases — first build session begins next turn. **Plus: the AI-Builder Handoff component (6 export formats — Claude Code / Cursor / Cline+Aider / GitHub Issue / JSON / Markdown) shipped this session along with default-on CI auto-repair (peter-evans/create-pull-request when ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is present), and the silent 20-finding-per-module truncation cap was raised to 200 with an honest overflow line so every issue reaches the UI + fix path.**

Date last updated: 2026-04-26 — v1.42.0: **THE FIX-FIRST BUILD PLAN — Phase 1, 2, 3 SHIPPED COMPLETE.** All four pricing tiers ($29 Quick, $99 Full, $199 Scan+Fix, $399 Nuclear) are wired through `/api/checkout/route.ts` `TIERS` and rendered in `Pricing.tsx` with honest deliverables backing every price tag.

Phase 1 (foundation): iterative fix loop with structured per-attempt logging, cross-fix syntax-validation gate, cross-file scanner re-validation gate, test-generation per fix, PR composer with before/after scan tables. **No competitor on the market today ships this combination on a per-scan price model.** 5 helper libraries shipped at `website/app/lib/` with 113 unit tests. 6 commits.

Phase 2 ($199 Scan + Fix): pair-review agent (second Claude critiques every fix on a 4-axis rubric), architecture annotator (codebase-shape design observations, informational only). 2 helper libraries shipped, 66 unit tests. Stripe wired, Pricing card live. 3 commits.

Phase 3 ($399 Nuclear): real Claude-driven diagnosis (replaced the lawsuit-shape templated shell-command "fixes"), cross-finding correlation engine (identifies attack chains across the full findings set), mutation testing (operators extracted to testable engine, 33 algorithm tests, real bug fixed during build: `return true` pattern lacked `\b` so it was matching `return trueish`), chaos / fuzz pass (Playwright-driven, 7 real tests covering URL resolution + graceful degradation), executive summary composer (CTO-readable single-document synthesis). 4 helper libraries + 1 mutation engine extraction. Stripe wired, Pricing card live. 6 commits.

Real-repo proofs (4 / 3 — requirement exceeded): self-scan + self-fix on the gatetest repo itself; full Nuclear pipeline on Crontech (754 errors, 23/39 modules pass, 2 critical chains found incl. supply-chain CI takeover); full Nuclear pipeline on Gluecron.com (649 errors, 26/39 modules pass, 3 chains incl. the cleverest reasoning of the build: "Hardcoded secret + undeclared `WORKFLOW_SECRETS_KEY` → secret rotation is impossible"); full Nuclear pipeline on MarcoReid.com (124 errors — found a textbook fintech bug: `parseFloat` on a money-named variable in `TrustActions.tsx` for a legal-tech product handling client trust money, AND the correlator HONESTLY returned 0 chains because findings were genuinely independent — proving the no-padding rule works as designed).

Total real-Claude Anthropic spend across all four proofs: ~$3-4. At $399 tier: 100x+ margin.

**Module count: 90 (unchanged — Phase 1-3 was about deepening capability per scan, not adding modules).** All 90 modules load cleanly via `node bin/gatetest.js --list`. Test count: 1300+. Sweep green at session end.

Phase 4 (honesty sweep) — IN FLIGHT this commit: 4.1 confirmed no modules need disabling, 4.2 compare/* pages updated to mention all four tiers, 4.3 VERSION string updated (this paragraph), 4.4 Known Issues table reviewed for items the FIX-FIRST plan resolved.
