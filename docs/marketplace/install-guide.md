# GateTest — install guide

Drop the GateTest action into any GitHub workflow with one `uses:` line.

---

## Quickstart

Create `.github/workflows/gatetest.yml`:

```yaml
name: GateTest
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  gate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
      checks: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: crclabs-hq/GateTest@v1.1.1
```

That is the entire install. Push the file, open a PR, the gate runs.

---

## With AI auto-repair

When the gate finds something it can fix, let Claude propose the patch:

```yaml
- uses: crclabs-hq/GateTest@v1.1.1
  with:
    suite: quick
    auto-fix: true
  env:
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

When the gate blocks and an Anthropic key is present, the action opens a follow-up PR with the proposed fix. The original failing PR is never modified — auto-repair runs as an additive workflow.

## Inputs

| Input | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `suite` | `quick` | Which suite to run: `quick` (4 modules), `full` (91), `scan_fix`, `nuclear`. |
| `auto-fix` | `false` | When `true` AND the gate blocks AND `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set, run the AI CI-fixer. |
| `node-version` | `22` | Node.js version to set up on the runner. GateTest requires Node 20+. |
| `working-directory` | `.` | Repository sub-directory to scan. Useful for monorepos. |
| `report-format` | `console` | Output format: `console`, `json`, `sarif`, or `junit`. |
| `fail-on-warning` | `false` | When `true`, warning-severity findings also block the gate. |
| `mutation` | `false` | When `true`, run mutation testing after the gate. Exercises the customer test runner. See Nuclear-tier deliverables below. |
| `chaos` | `false` | When `true` AND `chaos-url` is set, run live-browser chaos / runtime checks. Installs Playwright Chromium on the runner. See Nuclear-tier deliverables below. |
| `chaos-url` | `''` | Live URL to chaos-test (deployed staging or prod, NOT localhost). Required when `chaos: true`. |
| `mutation-blocks-merge` | `false` | When `true`, a failing mutation score blocks the merge. Off by default — mutation testing is coaching, not a gate. |
| `chaos-blocks-merge` | `false` | When `true`, chaos / runtime failures block the merge. Off by default — runtime resilience is graded, not binary. |

### Example: SARIF upload for GitHub Code Scanning

```yaml
- uses: crclabs-hq/GateTest@v1.1.1
  id: gatetest
  with:
    suite: full
    report-format: sarif

- name: Upload SARIF
  if: always()
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  with:
    sarif_file: ${{ steps.gatetest.outputs.report-path }}
```

### Example: monorepo

```yaml
- uses: crclabs-hq/GateTest@v1.1.1
  with:
    working-directory: ./apps/api
```

## Nuclear-tier deliverables via the Action

Two of the four Nuclear-tier deliverables — mutation testing and chaos / runtime testing — only ship via the GitHub Action, not via the website-only Nuclear flow.

**Why:** the website's Nuclear pipeline runs on Vercel serverless functions. Mutation testing needs to exercise the customer's own test runner; chaos testing needs to launch a Chromium browser against a live URL. Neither is safe or possible inside a stateless serverless function. Both run cleanly on a GitHub Actions runner, which has the customer test suite already checked out and can install browser binaries on demand.

**Honest disclosure:** if you paid for Nuclear via the website (paste a repo URL, get a scan back), you receive per-finding Claude diagnosis + cross-finding correlation + executive summary, but mutation and chaos are **not** part of that flow. To get the full four-deliverable Nuclear experience, use the Action.

### Mutation testing

Mutation testing applies real code mutations (operator swaps, boundary changes, return-value flips) to your source files, then verifies that at least one of your tests fails for each mutation. If all tests still pass after a mutation, your test suite has a coverage gap that line-coverage alone cannot see.

```yaml
- uses: crclabs-hq/GateTest@v1.1.1
  with:
    suite: nuclear
    mutation: true
    # mutation-blocks-merge defaults to false — failures surface as warnings.
    # Flip to true to gate the merge on mutation score.
    mutation-blocks-merge: false
```

Requirements:
- Your test suite must be runnable in CI. The module auto-detects `npm test` or `node --test`.
- Tests must pass on baseline. Mutation testing won't start with a red suite.
- Reasonable runtime budget — the module caps at 50 mutants by default.

### Chaos / runtime testing

Chaos testing drives a real Chromium browser against a deployed URL and injects five resilience scenarios (slow network, API failures, offline mode, missing CSS/JS, server timeouts). It reports whether your site degrades gracefully or shows blank pages and error screens.

```yaml
- uses: crclabs-hq/GateTest@v1.1.1
  with:
    suite: nuclear
    chaos: true
    chaos-url: 'https://staging.example.com'
    # chaos-blocks-merge defaults to false — runtime failures surface as warnings.
    chaos-blocks-merge: false
```

Requirements:
- A deployed URL — `chaos-url` must be a real HTTPS endpoint reachable from the runner. **Do not point at `localhost`** — there's nothing there.
- The Action installs Playwright Chromium on demand via `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`. No setup on your side beyond setting `chaos: true`.

### Both at once

```yaml
- uses: crclabs-hq/GateTest@v1.1.1
  with:
    suite: nuclear
    mutation: true
    chaos: true
    chaos-url: 'https://staging.example.com'
  env:
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

Mutation and chaos run after the main gate verdict. They never change the gate verdict on their own — they have their own opt-in `*-blocks-merge` toggles.

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `gate-status` | `passed` or `blocked`. |
| `error-count` | Number of error-severity findings. |
| `warning-count` | Number of warning-severity findings. |
| `report-path` | Filesystem path to the report file (empty when `report-format` is `console`). |

Read outputs in later steps with `${{ steps.<id>.outputs.<name> }}`.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required when | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `auto-fix: true` | Claude API key used by the AI CI-fixer. |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Auto-fix opens a PR | The default `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` is enough. |
| `GATETEST_RECIPE_STORE_URL` | Optional | Custom recipe-store endpoint for the flywheel layer. |
| `MAX_FIX_ATTEMPTS` | Optional | Cap on auto-fix retries (default 3). |
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | Optional | Override the Claude model used by the fixer. |

Set them in the `env:` block on the step or job — never commit secrets to the repo (Bible Forbidden #6).

## Suite comparison

| Suite | Modules | What runs | Typical use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `quick` | 4 critical modules | Secrets, syntax, dependencies, lint | PR gate on every push |
| `full` | All 102 modules | Everything the gate ships with | Pre-merge to main, nightly scan |
| `scan_fix` | 91 + fix loop | Full scan plus iterative Claude fix loop, pair-review, architecture annotator | Customers on the $199 tier |
| `nuclear` | 91 + correlation + adversarial | Full scan plus per-finding Claude diagnosis, cross-finding correlation, mutation testing, chaos/fuzz, executive summary | Customers on the $399 tier |

`quick` finishes in under 15 seconds on a typical repo. `full` targets under 60 seconds.

## Troubleshooting

**The action fails with `Cannot find module` on first run.**
Pin `node-version: 22` (or 20) explicitly. GateTest requires Node 20+.

**Auto-repair never opens a PR.**
Three common causes:
1. `auto-fix` is not set to `true`.
2. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is missing from the workflow `env:` block.
3. The findings are config-level (e.g. CI security) with no specific file path the fixer can patch. The fixer needs file-line metadata to apply a fix.

**The gate passes locally but fails on GitHub.**
The runner uses Node 22 by default and a clean working tree. Local environments may have unstaged changes or an older Node. Run `node bin/gatetest.js --suite quick` against a clean checkout locally to reproduce.

**The action takes too long on a large monorepo.**
Use the `working-directory` input to scope the scan to one app at a time, then run multiple jobs in parallel matrix style.

**Permissions error when auto-repair tries to push.**
The workflow needs `pull-requests: write` and `contents: read` (and `contents: write` if you want auto-repair to commit to a branch, not just open a PR from a fork). Add the block to your job:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  checks: write
```

**The npm package install fails.**
The action falls back to cloning the repo at runtime when `@gatetest/cli` is not yet on npm. This is expected at launch. The fallback path is functionally identical — only marginally slower.
