            <p>
              GateTest provides automated code quality scanning and analysis for software repositories.
              The Service includes static code analysis, security pattern detection, accessibility checking,
              performance analysis, and related quality assurance tools. The Service is an automated tool
              and does not constitute professional consulting, security auditing, legal compliance
              certification, or any form of professional advice.

            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">3. Payment Terms</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>3.1 Hold-then-charge model.</strong> When you purchase a scan, a hold (authorisation)
              is placed on your payment method for the full scan amount. The charge is captured only after
              the scan completes and results are delivered. If the scan cannot be completed due to access
              failure, service outage, or technical error on our part, the hold is released and no charge
              is made.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              <strong>3.2 Currency and processing.</strong> All prices are in US Dollars (USD). Payments
              are processed by Stripe, Inc. We do not store, process, or have access to your full credit
              card number. By providing payment information, you represent that you are authorised to use
              the payment method provided.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              <strong>3.3 Price changes.</strong> We reserve the right to change pricing at any time.
              Price changes do not affect scans already purchased. Current pricing is displayed on our
              website at the time of purchase and constitutes the binding price for that transaction.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              <strong>3.4 Taxes.</strong> Prices are exclusive of applicable taxes. You are responsible for
              any sales tax, VAT, GST, or similar taxes applicable in your jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              <strong>3.5 What &quot;delivery&quot; means.</strong> For the hold-then-charge model, the
              Service is considered <strong>delivered</strong> when a scan completes and a scan report
              is made available to you (via the web UI, email, PR comment, or API response). Delivery
              means that the Service has run the scan modules purchased and produced output. It does
              <strong> NOT</strong> mean (a) that the scan identified any specific number of issues,
              (b) that the scan identified all issues present in your code, (c) that any finding is
              correct or actionable, or (d) that your code is free of defects. Completion and delivery
              of a report is the service rendered; the content of the report is not a warranty.

            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">4. Repository Access and Authorisation</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>4.1 Grant of access.</strong> To perform a scan, you grant GateTest temporary,
              limited, read-only access to the specified repository solely for the purpose of performing
              the requested quality analysis. This access terminates immediately upon scan completion.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              <strong>4.2 Auto-fix access.</strong> For tiers that include auto-fix functionality, you
              additionally grant GateTest permission to create branches and submit pull requests to the
              specified repository. GateTest will never merge pull requests automatically — all merges
              require your explicit approval.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              <strong>4.3 Authorisation warranty.</strong> You represent and warrant that (a) you own the
              repository or have explicit authorisation from the owner to scan it, (b) scanning the
              repository does not violate any agreement, law, or third-party right, and (c) the repository
              does not contain content that is illegal in your jurisdiction. You agree to indemnify and
              hold harmless GateTest from any claims arising from your breach of this warranty.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              <strong>4.4 Prohibited use.</strong> You may not use the Service to scan repositories you
              do not own or have permission to scan. You may not use the Service to identify vulnerabilities
              in code for the purpose of exploiting them. You may not use the Service in any manner that
              violates applicable law.

              FOR REVIEWING, TESTING, AND APPROVING ALL AUTO-FIX CHANGES BEFORE MERGING THEM INTO

              complete, free of side effects, or suitable for your use case. Auto-fix changes may
              introduce new bugs, break existing functionality, or cause data loss. By using auto-fix,

            <p>
              <strong>8.1 Probabilistic output.</strong> The AI-powered code review module uses
              third-party AI services (currently Anthropic Claude) to analyse code. AI analysis is
              probabilistic in nature and may produce false positives (flagging non-issues), false
              negatives (missing real issues), hallucinated references, fabricated line numbers, or
              incorrect suggestions. AI review results are suggestions requiring human verification,
              not definitive assessments.

              <strong>8.2 Not professional advice.</strong> Scan findings, AI review output, and

              engineering advice, accounting advice, or any other form of professional advice. You

              <strong>8.3 No guarantee of findings.</strong> GateTest does not guarantee that the
              Service will identify every issue in your code, that any issue reported is in fact a
              real issue, that any auto-fix suggestion is correct, or that any severity
              classification is accurate for your context. A passing scan is not a warranty that

              or terminate your access to the Service, in whole or in part, at any time and for any
              reason or no reason, with or without notice, including but not limited to: violation
              of these Terms; suspected abusive behaviour or fraudulent payment activity; a chargeback
              or payment-method dispute; actions that harm or threaten to harm the Service, its

              reasonable belief that continued access creates risk to GateTest; or our decision to
              discontinue all or part of the Service.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              <strong>12.2 Notice where practicable.</strong> Where termination is not related to
              abuse, fraud, or legal obligation, we intend to provide at least fourteen (14) days&apos;
              written notice to the email address associated with your account, during which you
              may export your scan reports. Where immediate suspension is necessary to protect the

              process, you agree to contact us at hello@gatetest.ai with a written description of
              your concern, your account details, and the outcome you are seeking. We intend to
              acknowledge within three (3) business days and respond substantively within ten (10)
              business days. Both parties agree to attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute
              through direct negotiation for a period of at least thirty (30) days before
              proceeding further.
            </p>

              <strong>19.2 Agreement to arbitrate.</strong> If informal resolution does not resolve
              the dispute, then, except for the carve-outs in Section 19.5, <strong>you and GateTest
              agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these
              Terms or the Service shall be resolved by binding individual arbitration</strong>,
              and not in court, by jury, or as part of any class, collective, consolidated, or

              United States, by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer
              Arbitration Rules, with the small-claims-court carve-out in Section 19.5 preserved;
              (ii) for customers resident outside the United States, by the New Zealand
              International Arbitration Centre (NZIAC) under its Arbitration Rules, or, at the

            <p>
              <strong>24.1 Adult use.</strong> The Service is offered to, and may only be used by,
              individuals who are at least eighteen (18) years of age or the age of legal majority
              in their jurisdiction, whichever is greater. By using the Service, you represent and
              warrant that you meet this age requirement and have the legal capacity to enter into
              these Terms.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              <strong>24.2 Minors.</strong> We do not knowingly permit use of the Service by
              individuals under the age of eighteen (18). Where local law permits a younger user
              (for example, thirteen (13) or older with verifiable parental or guardian consent in
              the United States, or sixteen (16) or older in the EU under Article 8 GDPR), such use
              is only permitted with the verifiable consent of a parent or legal guardian who
              agrees to these Terms on the minor&apos;s behalf. We do not knowingly collect
              personal information from children under thirteen (13) in contravention of COPPA or
              from children under the applicable GDPR Article 8 age. If we become aware that a
              minor has used the Service without appropriate consent, we will terminate the account
              and delete the associated data.

              GateTest is not liable for any delay, failure to perform, or interruption of the
              Service caused by events or circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including
              but not limited to: acts of God; natural disasters (earthquake, flood, fire,
              volcanic eruption); war, invasion, armed conflict, terrorism, civil unrest, or
              insurrection; cyberattacks, distributed-denial-of-service attacks, or malware
              outbreaks affecting us or our sub-processors; failures or disruptions of
              telecommunications, internet backbone, DNS, or certificate-authority infrastructure;
              failures or outages of upstream providers (including Stripe, GitHub, Anthropic,
              Vercel, Cloudflare, or Neon); government action, embargo, sanction, export
              restriction, or change in law; labour disputes, strikes, or work stoppages; power
              failures; pandemic, epidemic, or public-health emergency; or any other event of the
              nature commonly described as force majeure. Where a force majeure event prevents
              completion of a scan, any Stripe hold is released without capture.

            <p>
              A failure or delay by either party to enforce any provision of these Terms is not a

              only if given in writing and signed by the waiving party. These Terms do not create
              any third-party beneficiary rights, except that the limitations of liability,
              disclaimers, and indemnities in favour of GateTest extend to the GateTest Parties
              identified in Section 10.
