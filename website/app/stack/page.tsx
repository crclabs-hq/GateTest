        <div className="text-base text-foreground leading-relaxed space-y-4">
          <p>
            We could have built one mega-product. We didn&apos;t, because no real customer wants
            a mega-product. They want{" "}
            <span className="font-semibold">the tool that solves the problem they have right now</span>{" "}
            — and they want to be able to drop it for a different tool tomorrow without unsubscribing
            from anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we built three small products that share a philosophy but not a billing surface.
            Use GateTest without ever signing up for Gluecron. Use Crontech without ever touching
            GateTest. Or use all three. The choice stays yours.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shared philosophy: <span className="font-semibold">pay-per-use where it works,
            no-subscription-pressure, and brutally honest about what each tool DOES and DOESN&apos;T do.</span>
          </p>

      <section className="px-6 py-12 max-w-3xl mx-auto border-t border-border text-center">

        <ul className="text-sm text-muted space-y-3 max-w-2xl mx-auto text-left">
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold text-foreground">Code on Gluecron, audited by GateTest:</span>{" "}
            push triggers a scan; failing scans block the merge. Same gate story as a GitHub repo,
            but on a git host that Claude actually understands.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold text-foreground">Scheduled jobs on Crontech, audited by GateTest:</span>{" "}
            the cron / background work that powers your product gets the same QA treatment as your
            request-path code. GateTest scans the job definition; Crontech runs it at the edge.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-semibold text-foreground">All three:</span>{" "}
            code on Gluecron, gated by GateTest at push-time, scheduled jobs running on Crontech.
            End-to-end coverage with three independent tools, three independent bills, three
            independent failure modes.
